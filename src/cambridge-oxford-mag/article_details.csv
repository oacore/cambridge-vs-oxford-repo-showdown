10.1016/j.psyneuen.2008.10.009	0787096B	Stress effects on declarative memory retrieval are blocked by a β-adrenoceptor antagonist in humans	Previous evidence indicates that stress hormone effects on memory consolidation depend on concurrent emotional arousal-induced noradrenergic activity. Here, we asked whether this is also true for stress effects on memory retrieval and hypothesized that administration of the β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol would block the effects of stress on declarative and procedural retrieval performance. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 44 healthy young men learned a list of emotional and neutral words (declarative memory task) and completed a serial reaction time task (procedural memory task). On the following day, participants received either a placebo or 40 mg propranolol orally. One hour later, they were exposed to stress (socially evaluated cold pressor test (SECPT)) or a control condition 30 min prior to retention testing. Stress selectively enhanced the retrieval of emotionally arousing words. Pretreatment with propranolol had no effect on memory alone but blocked the stress-induced memory enhancement for emotional words, confirming the importance of noradrenergic activity in stress effects on memory retrieval. Memory for neutral words and the procedural task was neither affected by stress nor by propranolol. The present findings suggest that stress (hormone) effects on emotional memory retrieval require concurrent noradrenergic activation. Procedural memory retrieval and the retrieval of neutral verbal material appear to be less susceptible to stress. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	6	2009

Five factors for mentoring have been identified herein: personal attributes, system requirements, pedagogical knowledge, modelling, and feedback, and items associated with each factor have also been justified in context of the literature. An original, literature-based survey instrument gathered 446 preservice teachers' perceptions of their mentoring for primary teaching. Data were analysed within the above-mentioned five factors with 331 final-year preservice teachers from nine Australian universities responding to their mentoring for science teaching and 115 final-year preservice teachers from an urban university responding to their mentoring for mathematics teaching. Results indicated similar Cronbach alpha scores on each of the five factors for primary science and mathematics teaching; however percentages and mean scores on attributes and practices aligned with each factor were considerably higher for mentoring mathematics teaching compared with science teaching.

10.1371/journal.pgen.1004050	002293A3	The Midline Protein Regulates Axon Guidance by Blocking the Reiteration of Neuroblast Rows within the Drosophila Ventral Nerve Cord	Guiding axon growth cones towards their targets is a fundamental process that occurs in a developing nervous system. Several major signaling systems are involved in axon-guidance, and disruption of these systems causes axon-guidance defects. However, the specific role of the environment in which axons navigate in regulating axon-guidance has not been examined in detail. In Drosophila, the ventral nerve cord is divided into segments, and half-segments and the precursor neuroblasts are formed in rows and columns in individual half-segments. The row-wise expression of segment-polarity genes within the neuroectoderm provides the initial row-wise identity to neuroblasts. Here, we show that in embryos mutant for the gene midline, which encodes a T-box DNA binding protein, row-2 neuroblasts and their neuroectoderm adopt a row-5 identity. This reiteration of row-5 ultimately creates a non-permissive zone or a barrier, which prevents the extension of interneuronal longitudinal tracts along their normal anterior-posterior path. While we do not know the nature of the barrier, the axon tracts either stall when they reach this region or project across the midline or towards the periphery along this zone. Previously, we had shown that midline ensures ancestry-dependent fate specification in a neuronal lineage. These results provide the molecular basis for the axon guidance defects in midline mutants and the significance of proper specification of the environment to axon-guidance. These results also reveal the importance of segmental polarity in guiding axons from one segment to the next, and a link between establishment of broad segmental identity and axon guidance.	8	2013

The insects were captured in Distrito Federal (urban area) and Rio de Janeiro city (beach, zoological garden, urban area and Tijuca forest). The most frequent species captured were: Calliphoridae - Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius, 1794) 78,9% and Chtysomya puloria (Wiedemann, 1818) 5,4% - and Sarcophagidae - Sarcophagula Wulp, 1887 2,3% and Peckya chrysostoma (Wiedemann. 1830) 2,2%. Fish was more attractive to females of Calliphoridae flies in intense ovarian vitelogenesis, although banana atracted more flies with mature eggs. Faeces and fish were more atractive for Sarcophagidae in the beggining of vitelogenesis.	5	1994

10.1155/S0962935194000682	0F815210	The Increased Expression of HLA-DR and ICAM-1 Molecules by Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells, Induced by Activated Mononuclear Cells, is Downregulated by Nedocromil Sodium.	To test the hypothesis that mononuclear cell products could increase the expression of HLA-DR and ICAM-1 molecules in bronchial epithelial cells (BECs), subconfluent cultures of human BECs, obtained from surgically resected bronchi, were incubated with PHA-activated blood mononuclear cell conditioned media (BCM-CM) or recombinant IFN-gamma. The presence of HLA-DR and ICAM-1 molecules on BECs was then evaluated by specific antibody staining and flow-cytometry analysis. The addition to BEC cultures of different concentrations of PHA-stimulated BMC-CM, or of IFN-gamma induced a dosedependent increase of HIA-DR and ICAM-1 expression, while no effect was observed with unstimulated BMC-CM. The ability of nedocromil sodium and, as control, of dexamethasone, to prevent the upregulation of HLA-DR and ICAM-1 expression on BECs was then tested. Increasing concentrations (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) of nedocromil significandy inhibited HLA-DR and ICAM-1 expression by BECs in a dose-dependent fashion. A similarly dose-dependent inhibitory effect was also observed with dexamethasone, which, however, was less active than nedocromil on HL-ADR expression and more active on ICAM-1 expression. Finally, nedocromil and dexamethasone showed a significant synergistic effect on the expression of both cell surface molecules at the lowest concentrations tested.	4	1994
10.1007/s10569-010-9317-z	0E50EBBE	On the stability of artificial equilibrium points in the circular restricted three-body problem	The article analyses the stability properties of minimum-control artificial equilibrium points in the planar circular restricted three-body problem. It is seen that when the masses of the two primaries are of different orders of magnitude, minimum-control equilibrium is obtained when the spacecraft is almost coorbiting with the second primary as long as their mutual distance is not too small. In addition, stability is found when the distance from the second primary exceeds a minimum value which is a simple function of the mass ratio of the two primaries and their separation. Lyapunov stability under non-resonant conditions is demonstrated using Arnold's theorem. Among the most promising applications of the concept we find solar-sail-stabilized observatories coorbiting with the Earth, Mars, and Venus.	7	2011
10.1016/j.ejvs.2004.02.001	055A1A2E	Elevation in plasma MMP-9 following carotid endarterectomy is associated with particulate cerebral embolisation	Objectives. To study plasma MMP-9 levels before and after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Design. Observational study. Methods. Pre-operative (morning of surgery) and post-operative (48 h) plasma samples were obtained from 75 consecutive patients undergoing CEA. MMP-9 concentrations were quantified using ELISA. Transcranial Doppler monitoring was performed on each patient to detect particulate embolisation during the dissection phase of the CEA, until the application of carotid clamps. Results. The median post-operative plasma MMP-9 level of emboli-positive patients was significantly higher than their median pre-operative value (14.9 ng/ml vs. 8.8 ng/ml; p = 0.038). However, no significant difference was seen in the plasma MMP-9 level of emboli-negative patients (7.7 ng/ml vs. 7.1 ng/ml; p = 0.364). A greater rise was seen in the median plasma MMP-9 levels of those patients suffering > 2 emboli (from 3.4 to 19.3 ng/ml; p = 0.041) than those patients suffering 1 or 2 emboli (from 10.1 to 12.8 ng/ml; p = 0.340). Conclusions. Plasma MMP-9 only rises after CEA in patients with evidence of embolisation. This increase is more pronounced in those with high numbers of emboli. These data suggest that the increase in MMP-9 is due to cerebral damage caused by embolisation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	6	2004
10.1016/j.saa.2012.02.011	031ACD6B	Raman spectroscopic study of the mineral arsenogorceixite BaAl3AsO3(OH)(AsO4,PO4)(OH,F)6	Arsenogorceixite BaAl(3)AsO(3)(OH)(AsO(4),PO(4))(OH,F)(6) belongs to the crandallite mineral subgroup of the alunite supergroup. Arsenogorceixite forms a continuous series of solid solutions with related minerals including gorceixite, goyazite, arsenogoyazite, plumbogummite and philipsbornite. Two minerals from (a) Germany and (b) from Ashburton Downs, Australia were analysed by Raman spectroscopy. The spectra show some commonality but the intensities of the peaks vary. Sharp intense Raman bands for the German sample, are observed at 972 and 814 cm(-1) attributed to the ν(1) PO(4)(3-) and AsO(4)(3-) symmetric stretching modes. Raman bands at 1014, 1057, 1148 and 1160 cm(-1) are attributed to the ν(1) PO(2) symmetric stretching mode and ν(3) PO(4)(3-) antisymmetric stretching vibrations. Raman bands at 764 and 776 cm(-1) and 758 and 756 cm(-1) are assigned to the ν(3) AsO(4)(3-) antisymmetric stretching vibrations. For the Australian mineral, the ν(1) PO(4)(3-) band is found at 973 cm(-1). The intensity of the arsenate bands observed at 814, 838 and 870 cm(-1) is greatly enhanced. Two low intensity Raman bands at 1307 and 1332 cm(-1) are assigned to hydroxyl deformation modes. The intense Raman band at 441 cm(-1) with a shoulder at 462 cm(-1) is assigned to the ν(2) PO(4)(3-) bending mode. Raman bands at 318 and 340 cm(-1) are attributed to the (AsO(4))(3-)ν(2) bending. The broad band centred at 3301 cm(-1) is assigned to water stretching vibrations and the sharper peak at 3473 cm(-1) is assigned to the OH stretching vibrations. The observation of strong water stretching vibrations brings into question the actual formula of arsenogorceixite. It is proposed the formula is better written as BaAl(3)AsO(3)(OH)(AsO(4),PO(4))(OH,F)(6)·xH(2)O. The observation of both phosphate and arsenate bands provides a clear example of solid solution formation.	2	2012

Considering the ground state of the rotating system as a function of the two conserved quantities, the total angular momentum and its collective component, we develop an algebraic approach to derive exact wave functions and energies of these ground states. We describe a broad class of the interactions for which these results are valid. This universality class is defined by simple integral condition on the potential. Most of the potentials of practical interest which have pronounced repulsive component belong to this universality class.	3	2001
10.1007/s10198-007-0087-9	05FE3361	The burden of rheumatoid arthritis and access to treatment: A medical overview	As part of the investigation into the burden of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the access to treatment, this article reviews the medical aspects of the disease. RA is mediated by a variety of pathogenic events which culminate in the activation of B-cells, T-cells and other cell populations and lead to secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. These events result in signs and symptoms of active disease, such as pain and swelling, joint damage and disability, the three cornerstones of the clinical expression of RA. Active disease leads to joint damage and both to disability, whereby joint destruction is associated with the irreversible portion of disability. The diagnosis of RA is based on characteristic clinical and laboratory features, however, these may not be obvious in early disease. Therapy aims at interfering with disease activity, ideally leading to remission, as well as at retarding, ideally holding or even healing, joint destruction. This can be achieved by using disease modifying anirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Among the chemical DMARDs, methotrexate is the anchor drug, although there exist many more such agents. Among the biological compounds, TNF-inhibitors have been in use for more than one decade, and co-stimulation blockade and B-cell targeted therapy have been recent additions to the armamentarium. Therapeutic outcome can be predicted by clinical means.	112	2008
10.1038/srep04122	036D31BB	Combined haploinsufficiency and purifying selection drive retention of RPL36a paralogs in Arabidopsis.	Whole-genome duplication events have driven to a large degree the evolution of angiosperm genomes. Although the majority of redundant gene copies after a genome duplication are lost, subfunctionalization or gene balance account for the retention of gene copies. The Arabidopsis 80S ribosome represents an excellent model to test the gene balance hypothesis as it consists of 80 ribosomal proteins, all of them encoded by genes belonging to small gene families. Here, we present the isolation of mutant alleles of the APICULATA2 (API2) and RPL36aA paralogous genes, which encode identical ribosomal proteins but share a similarity of 89% in their coding sequences. RPL36aA was found expressed at a higher level than API2 in the wild type. The loss-of-function api2 and rpl36aa mutations are recessive and affect leaf development in a similar way. Their double mutant combinations with asymmetric leaves2-1 (as2-1) caused leaf polarity defects that were stronger in rpl36aa as2-1 than in api2 as2-1. Our results highlight the role of combined haploinsufficiency and purifying selection in the retention of these paralogous genes in the Arabidopsis genome.	4	2014
10.1016/j.jlumin.2013.08.065	0224997B	Nanosecond fluctuation kinetics of luminescence hopping quenching originated from the 5d1 level in the Ce3+:YPO 4·0.8H2O nanocrystals	We study the nanosecond energy transfer kinetics detected at dipole allowed 5d1-4f1 transition and originated from the lowest 2Γ1 level of the Ce3+ ions doped into the rhabdophane-type YPO4·0.8H2O nanocrystals synthesized by microwave hydrothermal treatment. We show that the luminescence quenching in the nanocrystals is determined by two processes depending on Ce3+ (energy donor) concentration at constant OH- (energy acceptors) concentration. At 0.2 mol% Ce3+ the luminescence quenching is mainly determined by direct (static) quenching caused by vibrations of OH- groups. At 2.0 mol% Ce3+ the quenching accelerates due to energy migration from the Ce3+ ions with poor acceptor surrounding to the Ce3+ ions with the nearby OH- acceptors. In the latter case we observe fluctuation kinetics of the luminescence impurity hopping quenching starting immediately after static ordered stage of the decay kinetics. We obtain that for dipole allowed the 5d-4f transition in the Ce3+ donor the CDD microparameter of the Ce3+-Ce3+ energy migration and CDA microparameter of Ce3+-OH- energy transfer are in strong correlation with the higher spontaneous emission rate for dipole allowed transition in Ce3+ comparing to dipole forbidden transition in Nd3+. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.	2	2014

The structure of the generalized spectral function is described in terms of spectral data consisting of the eigenvalues and normalizing numbers of the matrix. The inverse problems from generalized spectral function as well as from spectral data are investigated. In this way, a procedure for construction of complex tridiagonal matrices having real eigenvalues is obtained.	2	2009
10.1080/00107510903083665	0F30BE67	Chaos and coarse graining in statistical mechanics.	A deep chasm still separates the microscopic world of atoms and molecules from the familiar macroscopic world that is part of everyday life. These worlds are profoundly different. In the former, time is reversible and the dynamics is Hamiltonian whereas, in the latter, we see dissipation, increasing entropy, and a very definite arrow of time.For equilibrium systems, Boltzmann’s revolutionary ideas of a century ago provide deep insight, and have stood the test of time. Supplemented by the quantum statistical mechanics that came later, they lead to an excellent description of large-scale behaviour based on properties at the atomic and molecular scale. Thus, equilibrium thermodynamics can be derived convincingly from statistical mechanics, with only a few leaps of faith along the way. The only requirement is that the number of particles should be large. For non-equilibrium and open systems, however, there are few such certainties. The discovery (or rediscovery) of dynamical chaos added a further dimension to the problem, because the statistical features typically observed in systems with many degrees of freedom can also be generated by deterministic chaos in simple systems. So what is the connection, if any?	13	2010

Destacam-se, nesta perspectiva, três abordagens: a tecnicista, baseada nos serviços, e a integradora. Esta última, em especial, destaca-se pela tentativa de estabelecer uma teoria única da inovação, que contemple tanto a indústria quanto os serviços, constituindo as conceituações necessárias para diferenciar suas especificidades. Neste sentido, este artigo procura investigar as bases teóricas para a aplicação da abordagem dos sistemas de inovação sobre o processo de inovação em serviços e, em especial, a consideração de uma dimensão espacial, local ou regional, a ser considerada em futuras investigações empíricas. Nossas considerações apontam na direção da pertinência deste enfoque, uma vez que o processo de aprendizagem, determinante do processo de inovação sob o novo paradigma, possui caráter delimitado geográfica, cultural e setorialmente, que está na fonte das vantagens competitivas das organizações. The analysis of innovation in services is recent in literature once this kind of innovation has for long been considered as a byproduct from innovation in manufacturing. Three approaches deserve more attention under this perspective: the technicist, the service-based and the integrated. The latter attempts to establish a single theory of innovation for manufacturing and services, including the necessary conceptualizing to distinguish their specificity. In this sense, this paper aims at investigating theoretical foundations for the application of the innovation systems approach to services, including a spatial, local or regional dimension in future empirical studies. The paper argues for the relevance of this approach once the learning process, decisive for the innovation process in the realm of the new paradigm, is related to geographical, cultural and sectoral boundaries that provide a source for competitive advantage for the organizations.	47	2006

10.1098/rspb.2011.1257	04353D03	Sex-biased dispersal, haplodiploidy and the evolution of helping in social insects	In his famous haplodiploidy hypothesis, W. D. Hamilton proposed that high sistersister relatedness facilitates the evolution of kin-selected reproductive altruism among Hymenopteran females. Subsequent analyses, however, suggested that haplodiploidy cannot promote altruism unless altruists capitalize on relatedness asymmetries by helping to raise offspring whose sex ratio is more female-biased than the population at large. Here, we show that haplodiploidy is in fact more favourable than is diploidy to the evolution of reproductive altruism on the part of females, provided only that dispersal is male-biased (no sex-ratio bias or active kin discrimination is required). The effect is strong, and applies to the evolution both of sterile female helpers and of helping among breeding females. Moreover, a review of existing data suggests that female philopatry and non-local mating are widespread among nest-building Hymenoptera. We thus conclude that Hamilton was correct in his claim that 'family relationships in the Hymenoptera are potentially very favourable to the evolution of reproductive altruism'.	70	2011

10.1103/PhysRevD.66.124001	05D4EC72	Qualitative and numerical study of the matter-radiation interaction in Kantowski-Sachs cosmologies	We examine, from both a qualitative and a numerical point of view, the evolution of Kantowski--Sachs cosmological models whose source is a mixture of a gas of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP's) and a radiative gas made up of a ``tightly coupled'' mixture of electrons, baryons and photons from the end of nucleosynthesis up to the duration of radiative interactions. In this cosmic era annihilation processes are negligible, while the WIMP's only interact gravitationally with the radiative gas and the latter behaves as a single dissipative fluid that can be studied within a hydrodynamical framework. Applying the full transport equations of Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics, coupled with the field and balance equations, we obtain a set of governing equations that becomes an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations once the shear viscosity relaxation time is specified; assuming the latter to be proportional to the Hubble time, the qualitative analysis indicates that models begin in the radiation dominated epoch close to an isotropic equilibrium point. We show how the relaxation time governs the relaxation of the models towards an equilibrium photon entropy, leading to ``near-Eckart'' and transient regimes associated with `abrupt' and `smooth' relaxation processes, respectively. Assuming the WIMP particle to be a super-symmetric neutralino of a 100$ GeV, the numerical analysis reveals that a physically plausible evolution, compatible with a stable equilibrium state and with observed bounds on CMB anisotropies and neutralino abundance, is only possible for models characterized by initial conditions associated with nearly zero spatial curvature and total initial energy density very close to unity.	1	2002
10.1111/j.1745-3933.2009.00663.x	01C66BED	The merger-driven evolution of warm infrared luminous galaxies	We present a merger-driven evolutionary model for the production of luminous (LIRGs) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with warm IR colours. Our results show that simulations of gas--rich major mergers including star formation, black hole growth, and feedback can produce warm (U)LIRGs. We also find that while the warm evolutionary phase is associated with increased AGN activity, star formation alone may be sufficient to produce warm IR colours. However, the transition can be suppressed entirely - even when there is a significant AGN contribution - when we assume a single-phase ISM, which maximizes the attenuation. Finally, our evolutionary models are consistent with the 25-to-60 micron flux density ratio vs. L_HX/L_IR relation for local LIRGs and ULIRGs, and predict the observed scatter in IR color at fixed L_HX/L_IR. Therefore, our models suggest a cautionary note in the interpretation of warm IR colours: while associated with periods of active black hole growth, they are probably produced by a complex mix of star formation and AGN activity intermediate between the cold star formation dominated phase and the birth of a bright, unobscured quasar.	14	2009

O acúmulo de acetato observado durante as condições de choque de carga e/ou estresse ocorre provavelmente devi- do às limitações cinéticas dos microrganismos metanogênicos, que é acentuada com a redução do pH. O acúmulo de acetato e hidrogênio na fase líquida pode, por sua vez, desencadear limitações termodinâmicas e conseqüente acúmulo de propionato e butirato. A manutenção de condições ideais de crescimento dos microrganismos metanogênicos é uma estratégia de controle para reduzir o acúmulo de acetato, embora não seja efetiva em reduzir a concentração de hidrogênio dissolvida ao ponto em que não haja limitação sintrófica. As estratégias para mitigação das limitações termodinâmicas poderiam envolver a regulação da concen- tração de acetato através do uso de resinas ou membranas, e a separação espacial de microrganismos através da granulação ou tratamento em duas fases.	11	2005
10.2105/AJPH.2011.300285	0350B045	Life course outcomes on mental and physical health: The impact of foster care on adulthood	OBJECTIVE: We compared the prevalence rates of mental health and physical health problems between adults with histories of childhood foster care and those without. METHODS: We used 2003-2005 California Health Interview Survey data (n = 70,456) to test our hypothesis that adults with childhood histories of foster care will report higher rates of mental and physical health concerns, including those that affect the ability to work, than will those without. RESULTS: Adults with a history of childhood foster care had more than twice the odds of receiving Social Security Disability Insurance because they were unable to work owing to mental or physical health problems for the past year, even after stratifying by age and adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood foster care may be a sentinel event, signaling the increased risk of adulthood mental and physical health problems. A mental and physical health care delivery program that includes screening and treatment and ensures follow-up for children and youths who have had contact with the foster care system may decrease these individuals' disproportionately high prevalence of poor outcomes throughout their adulthood.	19	2012
10.1152/jn.01074.2005	03D7F6CC	Control of the subthalamic innervation of substantia nigra pars reticulata by D1 and D2 dopamine receptors.	The effects of activating dopaminergic D1 and D2 class receptors of the subthalamic projections that innervate the pars reticulata of the subtantia nigra (SNr) were explored in slices of the rat brain using the whole cell patch-clamp technique. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) that could be blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxalene-2,3-dione and D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid were evoked onto reticulata GABAergic projection neurons by local field stimulation inside the subthalamic nucleus in the presence of bicuculline. Bath application of (RS)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride (SKF-38393), a dopaminergic D1-class receptor agonist, increased evoked EPSCs by approximately 30% whereas the D2-class receptor agonist, trans-(-)-4aR-4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9-octahydro-5-propyl-1H-pyrazolo(3,4-g)quinoline (quinpirole), reduced EPSCs by approximately 25%. These apparently opposing actions were blocked by the specific D1- and D2-class receptor antagonists: R-(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetra-hydro-1H-3-benzazepinehydrochloride (SCH 23390) and S-(-)-5-amino-sulfonyl-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-methyl]-2-methoxybenzamide (sulpiride), respectively. Both effects were accompanied by changes in the paired-pulse ratio, indicative of a presynaptic site of action. The presynaptic location of dopamine receptors at the subthalamonigral projections was confirmed by mean-variance analysis. The effects of both SKF-38393 and quinpirole could be observed on terminals contacting the same postsynaptic neuron. Sulpiride and SCH 23390 enhanced and reduced the evoked EPSC, respectively, suggesting a constitutive receptor activation probably arising from endogenous dopamine.

A reduction in axonal transport has also been implicated as a cause of axonal dystrophies and neurodegeneration, but there is a paucity of experimental data concerning the effects of ROS on axonal transport. We used live cell imaging to examine the effects of hydrogen peroxide on the axonal transport of mitochondria and Golgi-derived vesicles in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.\n\nRESULTS: Hydrogen peroxide rapidly inhibited axonal transport, hours before any detectable changes in mitochondrial morphology or signs of axonal degeneration. Mitochondrial transport was affected earlier and was more severely inhibited than the transport of Golgi-derived vesicles. Anterograde vesicle transport was more susceptible to peroxide inhibition than retrograde transport. Axonal transport partially recovered following removal of hydrogen peroxide and local application of hydrogen peroxide inhibited transport, suggesting that the effects were not simply a result of nerve cell death. Sodium azide, an ATP synthesis blocker, had similar effects on axonal transport, suggesting that ATP depletion may contribute to the transport inhibition due to hydrogen peroxide.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that inhibition of axonal transport is an early consequence of exposure to ROS and may contribute to subsequent axonal degeneration.	29	2012
10.1007/s12197-008-9032-8	06DA3980	Musgrave's "target saver" theory: Implications for macroeconomic stability and economic policy effectiveness	Musgrave develops the concept of the "target saver," in which the household saves in the present in order to finance a target level of consumption outlays in the future. The resulting household behavior is one in which a rise in the rate of interest in the present period reduces the amount of saving needed for future consumption, so that household saving is inversely rather than positively a function of the interest rate. The present study examines the potential implications of the target saver in the aggregate for macroeconomic stability and economic policy effectiveness.	2	2008

10.1103/PhysRevA.75.032110	03A46096	Evidence for the epistemic view of quantum states: A toy theory	We present a toy theory that is based on a simple principle: the number of questions about the physical state of a system that are answered must always be equal to the number that are unanswered in a state of maximal knowledge. A wide variety of quantum phenomena are found to have analogues within this toy theory. Such phenomena include: the noncommutativity of measurements, interference, the multiplicity of convex decompositions of a mixed state, the impossibility of discriminating nonorthogonal states, the impossibility of a universal state inverter, the distinction between bi-partite and tri-partite entanglement, the monogamy of pure entanglement, no cloning, no broadcasting, remote steering, teleportation, dense coding, mutually unbiased bases, and many others. The diversity and quality of these analogies is taken as evidence for the view that quantum states are states of incomplete knowledge rather than states of reality. A consideration of the phenomena that the toy theory fails to reproduce, notably, violations of Bell inequalities and the existence of a Kochen-Specker theorem, provides clues for how to proceed with this research program.	95	2007

10.1016/j.labeco.2010.12.009	00E2248E	The measurement of pay discrimination between job assignments	The traditional Becker/Arrow model of taste discrimination in pay depicts majority and minority labour as perfectly substitutable, implying that all workers perform precisely the same job assignment and have the same qualifications. The model is thus only appropriate for determining whether ceteris paribus pay differences between white workers and non-white workers, for example, performing job assignment A are attributable to prejudice ('within-assignment discrimination'). The model is inappropriate for determining whether ceteris paribus pay differences between white workers in assignment A and non-white workers in assignment B reflect prejudice ('cross-assignment discrimination'). We extend the traditional model to allow for cross-assignment discrimination and we propose an empirical methodology for its estimation. In so doing we address two broad questions: (1) Do predictions about cross-assignment discrimination vary with the form of the production function?; and (2) How can one estimate such discrimination when there is no common measure of productivity? We address the first question by deriving a measure of cross-assignment discrimination for four different production functions-Generalized Leontief, Quadratic, CES, and Cobb-Douglas. The Generalized Leontief provides the most general results, although closed form solutions are not possible. Closed form solutions are obtainable from the other three functions, but only under restrictive assumptions. There are two main findings. First, most predictions are generally robust across functional forms. Second, cross-assignment discrimination depends upon productivity and labour supply differences between the two worker groups, labour market structure, and the interaction between relative group productivity and prejudice. We address the second question by outlining, for future exploration, a two-stage regression methodology in which a standardised (i.e. common) measure of productivity is estimated separately for each occupation. This measure is then incorporated as a right-hand-side explanatory variable in a second-stage, all-occupation regression designed to estimate cross-assignment discrimination. We discuss the proposed methodology with reference to a valuable and interesting test case: The market for professional sports players. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.	6	2011

Between November 2008 and February 2009, 149 women were interviewed. The instrument Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix Cancer (FACT-Cx) was used to assess HRQoL and, in general, the scores obtained indicated positive evaluation. The items that showed negative evaluation were: I am interested in sex, I feel sexually attractive, I am afraid to have sex and My vagina feels too narrow or short. In multiple linear regression analysis, using the backward method, of the 18 independent variables, eight were predictive of HRQoL. Self-perceived health status was the most influential factor. Special attention should be given to the sexual dysfunctions of these women after radiotherapy.	7	2010
10.1016/0361-3682(94)90010-8	02D3CE77	The usefulness of management accounting systems, functional differentiation and managerial effectiveness	This study examines the role of broad scope information, made available by management accounting systems (MAS), in enhancing managerial performance. It is proposed that differentiation of activities into areas such as marketing and production is an organizational response to manage uncertainty. The paper argues that such differentiation of activities moderates the association between the extent to which managers use broad scope MAS information and performance. A study of 75 managers indicated that the association between the extent of use of broad scope MAS information and performance was stronger for managers of marketing than production activities.	39	1994
10.1186/1748-717X-9-50	0747FFFC	Deformable versus rigid registration of PET/CT images for radiation treatment planning of head and neck and lung cancer patients: a retrospective dosimetric comparison.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical impact of using deformable registration in tumor volume definition between separately acquired PET/CT and planning CT images.\n\nMETHODS: Ten lung and 10 head and neck cancer patients were retrospectively selected. PET/CT images were registered with planning CT scans using commercially available software. Radiation oncologists defined two sets of gross tumor volumes based on either rigidly or deformably registered PET/CT images, and properties of these volumes were then compared.\n\nRESULTS: The average displacement between rigid and deformable gross tumor volumes was 1.8 mm (0.7 mm) with a standard deviation of 1.0 mm (0.6 mm) for the head and neck (lung) cancer subjects. The Dice similarity coefficients ranged from 0.76-0.92 and 0.76-0.97 for the head and neck and lung subjects, respectively, indicating conformity. All gross tumor volumes received at least 95% of the prescribed dose to 99% of their volume. Differences in the mean radiation dose delivered to the gross tumor volumes were at most 2%. Differences in the fraction of the tumor volumes receiving 100% of the radiation dose were at most 5%.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The study revealed limitations in the commercial software used to perform deformable registration. Unless significant anatomical differences between PET/CT and planning CT images are present, deformable registration was shown to be of marginal value when delineating gross tumor volumes.	3	2014
10.1002/jgm.1045	02F6EB14	Human osteocalcin: A strong promoter for nitric oxide synthase gene therapy, with specificity for hormone refractory prostate cancer	BACKGROUND: Gene therapy has been identified as a promising treatment strategy for hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). We report, for the first time, the use of the human osteocalcin (hOC) promoter to control inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) transgene expression in HRPC. METHODS: Human prostate carcinoma cells (PC3, DU145, LNCaP), colon cancer cells (HT29) and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were transfected in vitro with constitutively driven CMV/iNOS or hOC/iNOS plasmid DNA by cationic lipid vector. End points of these experiments were Western blotting, NO(.) generation using the Greiss test to measure accumulated nitrite, and clonogenic assay. RESULTS: Transfection of the hOC/iNOS plasmid increased iNOS protein and total nitrite levels in PC3 and DU145 cells, but not LNCaP or HT29. Transfection with CMV/iNOS or hOC/iNOS resulted in no additional cytotoxicity in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells or in the non-prostate cell lines. However, transfection with either construct resulted in a greatly reduced cell survival (to 10-20%) in the androgen-independent PC3 and DU145 cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Utilising the tumour-type specific properties of the hOC promoter in tandem with the iNOS gene, we have demonstrated target cell specificity, and transgene activation, in the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and DU145), an effect absent in normal and androgen-dependent cells. Furthermore, the levels of NO(.) generated are comparable with those seen generated with constitutively (CMV)-driven iNOS. The data obtained from this study provide a basis for future development of hOC/iNOS gene therapy.	7	2007

The nanotube can be filled with only a liquid or a vapour phase according to the physicochemical characteristics of the wall and to the disjoining pressure associated with the liquid and vapour mother bulks of the fluid, regardless of the nature of the external mother bulk. In dynamics, flows through nanotubes can be much more important than classical Poiseuille flows. When the external mother bulk is of vapour, the flow can be a million times larger than the classical flows when slippage on wall does not exist.	14	2012
10.4161/psb.24030	055433E4	Aquaporin genes GintAQPF1 and GintAQPF2 from Glomus intraradices contribute to plant drought tolerance.	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, established between AM fungi (AMF) and roots of higher plants, occurs in most terrestrial ecosystems. It has been well demonstrated that AM symbiosis can improve plant performance under various environmental stresses, including drought stress. However, the molecular basis for the direct involvement of AMF in plant drought tolerance has not yet been established. Most recently, we cloned two functional aquaporin genes, GintAQPF1 and GintAQPF2, from AM fungus Glomus intraradices. By heterologous gene expression in yeast, aquaporin localization, activities and water permeability were examined. Gene expressions during symbiosis in expose to drought stress were also analyzed. Our data strongly supported potential water transport via AMF to host plants. As a complement, here we adopted the monoxenic culture system for AMF, in which carrot roots transformed by Ri-T DNA were cultured with Glomus intraradices in two-compartment Petri dishes, to verify the aquaporin gene functions in assisting AMF survival under polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment. Our results showed that 25% PEG significantly upregulated the expression of two aquaporin genes, which was in line with the gene functions examined in yeast. We therefore concluded that the aquaporins function similarly in AMF as in yeast subjected to osmotic stress. The study provided further evidence to the direct involvement of AMF in improving plant water relations under drought stresses.	15	2013

Finally the model is compared with a previously studied one to show that a difference in the nature of the absorbing states places them in different universality classes.	0	1997

Propionibacterium acnes can be involved in inflammatory acne.\n\nOBJECTIVES: This case-control study aimed at investigating the occurrence and localization of P. acnes in facial biopsies in acne and to characterize the P. acnes phylotype in skin compartments.\n\nMETHODS: Specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were applied to skin biopsies of 38 patients with acne and matching controls to localize and characterize P. acnes and to determine expression of co-haemolysin CAMP factor, a putative virulence determinant.\n\nRESULTS: Follicular P. acnes was demonstrated in 18 (47%) samples from patients with acne and eight (21%) control samples [odds ratio (OR) 3·37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·23-9·23; P = 0·017]. In 14 (37%) samples from patients with acne, P. acnes was visualized in large macrocolonies/biofilms in sebaceous follicles compared with only five (13%) control samples (OR 3·85, 95% CI 1·22-12·14; P = 0·021). Macrocolonies/biofilms consisting of mixed P. acnes phylotypes expressing CAMP1 were detected in both case and control samples. Only four samples tested positive for the presence of Staphylococcus spp. and fungi were not observed.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We have for the first time visualized different P. acnes phylotypes in macrocolonies/biofilms in sebaceous follicles of skin biopsies. Our results support the hypothesis that P. acnes can play a role in the pathogenesis of acne as acne samples showed a higher prevalence of follicular P. acnes colonization, both in terms of follicles containing P. acnes and the greater numbers of bacteria in macrocolonies/biofilms than in control samples.	30	2012

Among its many distinguishing features which lead to the above results are (i) the vacuum is degenerate under a global $su(3)$ symmetry which plays the role of fermion generations, (ii) the fermion mass matrix is "universal", rank-one and rotates (changes its orientation in generation space) with changing scale $\mu$, (iii) the metric in generation space is scale-dependent too, and in general non-flat, (iv) the theta-angle term in the QCD action of topological origin gets transformed into the CP-violating phase of the CKM matrix for quarks, thus offering at the same time a solution to the strong CP problem.	4	2012

10.1086/305885	01852EB9	Envelope structure on 700 AU scales and the molecular outflows of low-mass young stellar objects.	Aperture synthesis observations of HCO+ J = 1-0, 13CO 1-0, and C18O 1-0 obtained with the Owens Valley Millimeter Array are used to probe the small-scale (5" approximately 700 AU) structure of the molecular envelopes of a well-defined sample of nine embedded low-mass young stellar objects in Taurus. The interferometer results can be understood in terms of: (1) a core of radius approximately or less than 1000 AU surrounding the central star, possibly flattened and rotating; (2) condensations scattered throughout the envelope that may be left over from the inhomogeneous structure of the original cloud core or that may have grown during collapse; and (3) material within the outflow or along the walls of the outflow cavity. Masses of the central cores are 0.001-0.1 M (solar), and agree well with dust continuum measurements. Averaged over the central 20" (3000 AU) region, an HCO+ abundance of 4 x 10(-8) is inferred, with a spread of a factor of 3 between the different sources. Reanalysis of previously presented single-dish data yields an HCO+ abundance of (5.0 +/- 1.7) x 10(-9), which may indicate an average increase by a factor of a few on the smaller scales sampled by the interferometer. Part of this apparent abundance variation could be explained by contributions from extended cloud emission to the single-dish C18O lines, and uncertainties in the assumed excitation temperatures and opacities. The properties of the molecular envelopes and outflows are further investigated through single-dish observations of 12CO J = 6-5, 4-3, and 3-2, 13CO 6-5 and 3-2, and C18O 3-2 and 2-1, obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell and IRAM 30 m telescopes, along with the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. Ratios of the mid-J CO lines are used to estimate the excitation temperature, with values of 25-80 K derived for the gas near line centre. The outflow wings show a similar range, although Tex is enhanced by a factor of 2-3 in at least two sources. In contrast to the well-studied L1551 IRS 5 outflow, which extends over 10' (0.4 pc), seven of the remaining eight sources are found to drive 12CO 3-2 outflows over < or = 1' (0.04 pc); only L1527 IRS has a well-developed outflow of some 3'(0.12 pc). Estimates are obtained for the outflow kinetic luminosity, Lkin, and the flow momentum rate, FCO, applying corrections for line opacity and source inclination. The flow force FCO correlates with the envelope mass and with the 2.7 mm flux of the circumstellar disk. Only a weak correlation is seen with Lbol, while none is found with the relative age of the object as measured by integral Tmb(HCO+ 3-2)dV/Lbol. These trends support the hypothesis that outflows are driven by accretion through a disk, with a global mass infall rate determined by the mass and density of the envelope. The association of compact HCO+ emission with the walls of the outflow cavities indicates that outflows in turn influence the appearance of the envelopes. It is not yet clear, however, whether they are actively involved in sweeping up envelope material, or merely provide a low-opacity pathway for heating radiation to reach into the envelope.	20	1998
10.1016/j.ppnp.2006.09.001	1292F80D	On the running coupling constant in QCD	We try to review the main current ideas and points of view on the running coupling constant in QCD. We begin by recalling briefly the classic analysis based on the Renormalization Group Equations with some emphasis on the exact solutions for a given number of loops, in comparison with the usual approximate expressions. We give particular attention to the problem of eliminating the unphysical Landau singularities, and of defining a coupling that remains significant at infrared scales. We consider various proposals for couplings directly related to the quark-antiquark potential or to other physical quantities (effective charges) and discuss optimization in the choice of the scale parameter and of the renormalization scheme. Our main focus is, however, on dispersive methods, their application and their relation with non-perturbative effects. We try also to summarize the main results obtained by Lattice simulations, in particular various MOM schemes. We conclude by briefly recalling the traditional comparisons with experimental data. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	12	2007
10.1038/sj.onc.1204636	00EB2176	The metastasis-associated Mts1(S100A4) protein could act as an angiogenic factor.	The involvement of Mts1(S100A4), a small Ca(2+)-binding protein in tumor progression and metastasis had been demonstrated. However, the mechanism by which mts1(S100A4) promoted metastasis had not been identified. Here we demonstrated that Mts1(S100A4) had significant stimulatory effect on the angiogenesis. We detected high incidence of hemangiomas--benign tumors of vascular origin in aged transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing the mts1(S100A4) gene. Furthermore, the serum level of the Mts1(S100A4) protein increased with ageing. Tumors developed in Mts1-transgenic mice revealed an enhanced vascular density. We showed that an oligomeric, but not a dimeric form of the Mts1(S100A4) protein was capable of enhancing the endothelial cell motility in vitro and stimulate the corneal neovascularization in vivo. An oligomeric fraction of the protein was detected in the conditioned media as well as in human serum. The data obtained allowed us to conclude that mts1(S100A4) might induce tumor progression via stimulation of angiogenesis.	21	2001

Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI was performed in nine healthy subjects using T2* weighted echo planar imaging. Brain volumes (52 transverse slices, cortex to high spinal cord) were acquired every 3.9 s. The 30 min paradigm consisted of six, 5-min cycles, each cycle comprising 45 s of hypoxic-isocapnia, 45 s of isooxic-hypercapnia and 45 s of hypoxic-hypercapnia, with 55 s of non-stimulatory hyperoxic-isocapnia (control) separating each stimulus period. Ventilation was significantly (p < 0.001) increased during hypoxic-isocapnia, isooxic-hypercapnia and hypoxic-hypercapnia (17.0, 13.8, 24.9 L/min respectively) vs. control (8.4 L/min) and was associated with significant (p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) signal increases within a bilateral network that included the basal ganglia, thalamus, red nucleus, cerebellum, parietal cortex, cingulate and superior mid pons. The neuroanatomical structures identified provide evidence for the spontaneous control of breathing to be mediated by higher brain centres, as well as respiratory nuclei in the brainstem. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

10.1016/j.shpsc.2013.03.014	04818A80	Synthetic biology and the technicity of biofuels	The principal existing real-world application of synthetic biology is biofuels. Several 'next generation biofuel' companies-Synthetic Genomics, Amyris and Joule Unlimited Technologies-claim to be using synthetic biology to make biofuels. The irony of this is that highly advanced science and engineering serves the very mundane and familiar realm of transport. Despite their rather prosaic nature, biofuels could offer an interesting way to highlight the novelty of synthetic biology from several angles at once. Drawing on the French philosopher of technology and biology Gilbert Simondon, we can understand biofuels as technical objects whose genesis involves processes of concretisation that negotiate between heterogeneous geographical, biological, technical, scientific and commercial realities. Simondon's notion of technicity, the degree of concretisation of a technical object, usefully conceptualises this relationality. Viewed in terms of technicity, we might understand better how technical entities, elements, and ensembles are coming into being in the name of synthetic biology. The broader argument here is that when we seek to identify the newness of disciplines, their newness might be less epistemic and more logistic. © 2013 .	28	2013
10.1108/09649420210445776	0831094F	Moving into management: gender segregation and its effect on managerial attainment	Steady progress has been achieved with implementing legislated public sector equal employment opportunities (EEO) policies and programs to fulfil the aim of increasing the representation of EEO groups in public employment. However, there remain areas of significant gender differences in the public sector labour market. One of the most persistent problems has been segregation by gender and this characteristic employment pattern can be discerned across industry, occupation, firm and type of employment contract. This research compares and contrasts the effect of gender domination on the gender composition of tiers of management and numbers in the Senior Executive Service across a state government public service in Australia. The career progression of males and females in female dominated and male dominated agencies are examined to determine whether different career outcomes can be discerned under conditions of significantly greater numbers of one gender being employed. Findings indicate that men in female-dominated agencies have different employment profiles and career patterns to those of women in male dominated agencies.	4	2002

We study analytically the correlations between the positions of tagged particles in the random average process, an interacting particle system in one dimension. We show that in the steady state, the mean-squared autofluctuation of a tracer particle grows subdiffusively sigma(2)0(t) approximately t(1/2) for large time t in the absence of external bias but grows diffusively sigma(2)0(t) approximately t in the presence of a nonzero bias. The prefactors of the subdiffusive and diffusive growths, as well as the universal scaling function describing the crossover between them, are computed exactly. We also compute sigma(2)(r)(t), the mean-squared fluctuation in the position difference of two tagged particles separated by a fixed tag shift r in the steady state and show that the external bias has a dramatic effect on the time dependence of sigma(2)(r)(t). For fixed r,sigma(2)(r)(t) increases monotonically with t in the absence of bias, but has a nonmonotonic dependence on t in the presence of bias. Similarities and differences with the simple exclusion process are also discussed.	7	2001
10.1111/j.1464-5491.2004.01228.x	068D90DD	Nutrient intakes; biochemical and risk indices associated with Type 2 diabetes and glycosylated haemoglobin, in the British National Diet and Nutrition Survey of people aged 65 years and over	AIMS: To characterize nutritional differences between survey participants diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes; those without diabetes, and those with "undiagnosed diabetes" based on glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The 1994/5 British National Diet and Nutrition Survey, of people aged 65 years and over (mean age 78 years), included 73 respondents with diagnosed Type 2 diabetes [mean (sd) HbA(1c) = 7.06 (2.05)%], and 30 with "undiagnosed diabetes" (defined as HbA(1c) > 6.3%; mean (sd) HbA(1c) = 7.40 (1.66)%], among a representative sample of 1038 with anthropometry; 4-day weighed diet; blood and urine status measurements. RESULTS: The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes (diagnosed + undiagnosed) was 10%. In subjects without diagnosis of diabetes, those with HbA(1c) > 6.3% had on average a significantly higher body weight (73.6 vs. 67.9 kg), higher waist circumference (99.8 vs. 91.8 cm), higher body mass index (28.6 vs. 25.9 kg/m(2)) and higher white cell counts (7.64 vs. 7.09 x 10(9)/l), than those with mean HbA(1c) < or = 6.3%. Diagnosed diabetic subjects had significantly higher energy-adjusted intakes of protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals than those not in this category (P < 0.01). In contrast, those with undiagnosed diabetes (HbA(1c) > 6.3%) were nutritionally "at risk", having low plasma concentrations of lycopene (0.13 vs. 0.24 micromol/l) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.99 vs. 1.27 micromol/l) and a trend towards low vitamin C (24 vs. 36 micromol/l) which was significant (P < 0.01) for men. HbA(1c) was positively correlated with white cell count, plasma fasting triglycerides, plasma alkaline phosphatase and homocysteine (all P < 0.01 overall), being particularly striking amongst men. CONCLUSIONS: Among older British citizens, those with diagnosed diabetes had healthier nutritional profiles than those undiagnosed with high HbA(1c). Important health-promoting benefits are therefore predicted following early diagnosis and nutritional advice for people with Type 2 diabetes.	7	2004
10.1016/j.enpol.2012.08.002	07684C76	Exploring the scope for complementary sub-global policy to mitigate CO 2 from shipping	For a high probability of avoiding dangerous interference with the climate system, all sectors must decarbonise over coming decades. Although shipping is an energy efficient transport mode, its emissions continue to grow. Compounding this, the sector's complexity, exclusion from emission inventories and slow progress towards a mitigation strategy, limit drivers towards meaningful change. Whilst there remains a preference within the industry for global mitigation policies, the urgency of required emission cuts necessitates exploration of complimentary sub-global measures. The debate surrounding such measures tends to focus on apportioning global shipping emissions to nations. To explore the policy implications of apportionment, the UK is used in this paper to illustrate how available apportionment regimes produce a wide range of emission estimates. Moreover, in the absence of transparent fuel consumption and freight data, they have limited sensitivity, rendering them currently obsolete for monitoring purposes. Nations, regions and organisations influence shipping, particularly in relation to operations, yet debate surrounding apportionment has arguably delayed consideration of sub-global polices and indicators. This paper makes a case for putting the apportionment debate aside in the short-term to open out the full span of options, consider influence over aspects of the shipping system, and how to monitor success. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.	37	2012

Its complete spectrum with respect to the spin network basis is obtained. It turns out that $\hat{Q}[\omega]$ is diagonalized in this basis, and it is a well defined self-adjoint operator on ${\cal H}$. The same conclusions are also tenable on the SU(2) gauge invariant Hilbert space with the gauge invariant spin network basis.	0	2000
10.1186/2045-7022-2-6	03454003	Retraction: Vitamin C and asthma in children: modification of the effect by age, exposure to dampness and the severity of asthma	BACKGROUND: We previously found a significant benefit of vitamin C supplementation in asthmatic children.\n\nPURPOSE: To test whether the effect of vitamin C on asthma is heterogeneous over the participant population.\n\nMETHODS: Egyptian asthmatic children between 7 and 10 years of age (n = 60) were included in the cross-over trial. They were administered 0.2 grams per day of vitamin C and placebo for separate 6-week periods. The variation in the vitamin C effect on two clinically relevant outcomes was analyzed: the childhood asthma control test (C-ACT), which measures the severity of asthma symptoms (the scale ranges from 0 to 27 points, < 20 points indicating unsatisfactory asthma control), and FEV1. We used linear modeling to examine the variation of the vitamin C effect in the subgroups.\n\nRESULTS: The effect of vitamin C on the C-ACT was significantly modified by age and baseline C-ACT levels. In the children aged 7.0-8.2 years with a baseline C-ACT of 18 to 19 points, vitamin C increased the C-ACT score by 4.2 points (95% CI: 3.3-5.3); whereas in the children aged 8.3-10 years who had a baseline C-ACT of 14 to 15 points, vitamin C increased the C-ACT score by only 1.3 points (95% CI: 0.1-2.5). The effect of vitamin C on the FEV1 levels was significantly modified by age and exposure to dampness. In the children aged 7.0-8.2 years with no exposure to dampness, vitamin C increased the FEV1 level by 37% (95% CI: 34-40%), whereas in the children aged 8.3-10 years with exposure to dampness or mold in their bedroom more than one year prior to the study, vitamin C increased the FEV1 level by only 21% (95% CI: 18-25%).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We found strong evidence that the effect of vitamin C on asthmatic children is heterogeneous. Further research is needed to confirm our findings and identify the groups of children who would receive the greatest benefit from vitamin C supplementation.	10	2012
10.1063/1.3105923	0720D429	Realization schemes for quantum instruments in finite dimensions	We present a general dilation scheme for quantum instruments with continuous outcome space in finite dimensions, in terms of an indirect POVM measurement performed on a finite dimensional ancilla. The general result is then applied to a large class of instruments generated by operator frames, which contains group-covariant instruments as a particular case, and allows to construct dilation schemes based on a measurement on the ancilla followed by a conditional feed-forward operation on the output. In the case of tight operator frames our construction generalizes quantum teleportation and telecloning, producing a whole family of generalized teleportation schemes in which the instrument is realized via a joint POVM at the sender combined with a conditional feed-forward operation at the receiver.	3	2009
10.1002/cbic.200900590	0019CE10	Engineering allosteric regulation into biological catalysts	Enzymes and ribozymes constitute two classes of biological catalysts. The activity of many natural enzymes is regulated by the binding of ligands that have different structures than their substrates; these ligands are consequently called allosteric effectors. In most allosteric enzymes, the allosteric binding site lies far away from the active site. This implies that communication pathways must exist between these sites. While mechanisms of allosteric regulation were developed more than forty years ago, they continue to be revisited regularly. The improved understanding of these mechanisms has led in the past two decades to projects to transform several unregulated enzymes into allosterically regulated ones either by rational design or directed evolution techniques. More recently, ribozymes have also been the object of similar successful engineering efforts. In this review, after briefly summarising recent progress in the theories of allosteric regulation, several strategies to engineer allosteric regulations in enzymes and ribozymes are described and compared. These redesigned biological catalysts find applications in a variety of areas.	25	2009
10.1159/000087751	06E0D5D3	Hormone treatment of the adult transsexual patient	Hormonal reassignment has two aims: (1) to reduce the hormonally induced secondary sex characteristics of the original sex and (2) to induce the secondary sex characteristics of the new sex. In Europe, cyproterone acetate is generally used to inhibit androgens in male-to-female transsexuals. Medroxyprogesterone acetate is an acceptable, though less effective, alternative. To induce feminization there is a wide range of oestrogens. Oral ethinyloestradiol is a potent and inexpensive oestrogen, but it may cause venous thrombosis. Oral 17beta-oestradiol valerate or transdermal 17beta-oestradiol is the treatment of choice. The goal of treatment in female-to-male transsexuals is to induce virilization, including a male pattern of sexual hair, a male voice and male physical contours, and to stop menses. The principal hormonal treatment is a testosterone preparation. Hormone-dependent tumours have been encountered and surveillance is necessary.	24	2005
10.1002/chem.201002519	03FC5377	A solution NMR study of the interactions of oligomannosides and the anti-HIV-1 2G12 antibody reveals distinct binding modes for branched ligands	The structural and affinity details of the interactions of synthetic oligomannosides, linear (di-, tri-, and tetra-) and branched (penta- and hepta-), with the broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibody 2G12 (HIV=human immunodeficiency virus) have been investigated in solution by using ligand-based NMR techniques, specifically saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy and transferred NOE experiments. Linear oligomannosides show similar binding modes to the antibody, with the nonreducing terminal disaccharide Manα(1→2)Man (Man=mannose) making the closest protein/ligand contacts in the bound state. In contrast, the branched pentamannoside shows two alternate binding modes, involving both ligand arms (D2- and D3-like), a dual binding description of the molecular recognition of this ligand by 2G12 in solution that differs from the single binding mode deduced from X-ray studies. On the contrary, the antibody shows an unexpected selectivity for one arm (D1-like) of the other branched ligand (heptamannoside). This result explains the previously reported lack of affinity enhancement relative to that of the D1-like tetramannoside. Single-ligand STD NMR titration experiments revealed noticeable differences in binding affinities among the linear and branched ligands in solution, with the latter showing decreased affinity. Among the analyzed series of ligands, the strongest 2G12 binders were the linear tri- and tetramannosides because both show similar affinity for the antibody. These results demonstrate that NMR spectroscopic techniques can deliver abundant structural, dynamics, and affinity information for the characterization of oligomannose-2G12 binding in solution, thus complementing, and, as in the case of the pentamannoside, extending, the structural view from X-ray crystallography. This information is of key importance for the development of multivalent synthetic gp120 high-mannose glycoconjugate mimics in the context of vaccine development.	14	2011

10.1016/j.abb.2004.02.034	0C4C4B2C	Controlled glycosylation of therapeutic antibodies in plants	Recombinant therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb) can be expressed, assembled, and glycosylated in plants. Transgenic plants, producing anti-rabies mAb and anti-colorectal cancer mAb, were obtained from Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The heavy chain (HC) of anti-rabies mAb was fused to the Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) endoplasmic reticulum retention signal whereas the HC of anti-colorectal cancer mAb was not fused to the KDEL sequence. Gel release of glycans and detection by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), together with computer assisted analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALD-TOF) mass spectrometry, revealed that the plant-derived anti-rabies mAb with KDEL contained mainly oligomannose type N-glycans while the plant-derived anti-colorectal cancer mAb carried mainly biantennary glycans with and without a pentose sugar, that is thought to be xylose. This finding indicates that the KDEL sequence can affect the N-glycosylation processing of antibody in plant cells. The plant-derived mAbs with addition of a KDEL sequence did not contain any of the known antigenic glycan epitopes that are frequently found in other plant glycans or in mammalian-derived mAbs. The altered glycosylation on both plant-derived mAbs did not affect the activities that are required for therapy. These results indicate that plant genetic engineering could provide an effective and inexpensive means to control the glycosylation of therapeutic proteins such as mAbs, by the addition of a KDEL signal as a regulatory element. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

10.1111/j.1467-9299.2010.01868.x	087E51BD	The content and context of organizational ethics	The aim of this paper is to provide an empirical contextual picture of what is truly valued most in different public and private sector organizations. Through a series of qualitative in-depth interviews (n = 38), that were a follow-up to an earlier survey study among public and private sector managers (n = 382), a number of crucial organizational values were presented to and discussed with a selection of top managers from a variety of Dutch public and private sector organizations. The decision-making context from the interviews provides insight into why, when, how and to what extent specific values are important. A number of unexpected differences and similarities between organizations with a different sectoral status emerge from the data, which shed new light on existing predispositions on value preferences in government and business conduct.	11	2011

10.1186/1471-230X-10-85	0A9D9B64	A meta-analysis for the effect of prophylactic GTN on the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis and on the successful rate of cannulation of bile ducts.	BACKGROUND: Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) has been shown to be able to relax the sphincter of Oddi (SO) both in animals and humans. Theoretically, the use of these compounds during and after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatgraphy (ERCP) could relax the biliary and pancreatic sphincters, facilitating cannulation of common bile duct (CBD) during the procedure, or minimizing potential pancreatic outflow obstruction after the procedure. However, clinical trials evaluating the protective effect of GTN on the post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatgraphy pancreatitis (PEP) have yielded inconclusive results. This meta-analysis is to systematically assess the effect of prophylactic administration of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) on the prevention of PEP and the effect on the cannulation of bile ducts. METHODS: By searching PubMed (1966 to September 2009), CENTRAL (Cochrane Controlled trials Register; issue 3, 2009) and EMBASE.com (1984 to September 2009), two independent reviewers systematically identified prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) detecting the effect of prophylactic GTN on the incidence of PEP and on the cannulation of bile ducts. A meta-analysis of these clinical trials was then performed. RESULTS: There are 55/899(6.1%) patients suffering PEP in the treatment group versus 95/915(10.4%) patients in the placebo group. The overall pooled risk of PEP was significantly lower in the GTN group than in the placebo group (OR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.79, p = 0.001). Subgroup analyses suggested that GTN administered by the sublingual form (OR 0.34,95% CI:0.16 to 0.75, p = 0.007) is more effective than transdermal route(OR 0.64,95% CI:0.40 to 1.01, p = 0.05), and the protective effect of GTN was far more obvious in the centers with high incidence of PEP (OR 0.40, 95% CI:0.24 to 0.67, p = 0.0006) than those centers with a low incidence of PEP (OR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.20, p = 0.22). Additionally, the meta-analysis suggests that GTN was not helpful for the cannulation of bile ducts. CONCLUSION: We concluded that prophylactic administration of GTN may significantly reduce the incidence of PEP and not be helpful for the cannulation of bile ducts.	6	2010

10.3945/jn.109.105312	029616AB	Landscape analysis of interactions between nutrition and vaccine responses in children.	The world's poorest children are likely to be malnourished when receiving their childhood vaccines. It is uncertain whether this affects vaccine efficacy and whether the coadministration of nutrient supplements with vaccines has beneficial or detrimental effects. More recently, a detrimental interaction between vitamin A (VA) supplementation (VAS) and the killed diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine given in early childhood has been suggested. This report provides a critical review of the published interactions between nutritional status and/or supplementation and vaccine responses in children. Due to an absence of evidence for most nutrients, this analysis focused on protein-energy, vitamins A and D, and iron and zinc. All vaccines were considered. Both observational studies and clinical trials that led to peer-reviewed publications in English or French were included. These criteria led to a pool of 58 studies for protein-energy malnutrition, 43 for VA, 4 for vitamin D, 10 for iron, and 22 for zinc. Our analysis indicates that malnutrition has surprisingly little or no effect on vaccine responses. Evidence for definitive adjunctive effects of micronutrient supplementation at the time of vaccination is also weak. Overall, the paucity, poor quality, and heterogeneity of data make it difficult to draw firm conclusions. The use of simple endpoints that may not correlate strongly with disease protection adds uncertainty. A detailed examination of the immunological mechanisms involved in potential interactions, employing modern methodologies, is therefore required. This would also help us understand the proposed, but still unproven, negative interactions between VAS and vaccine safety, a resolution of which is urgently required.	36	2009

10.1086/503528	0A48A450	Photometric Identification of Type Ia Supernovae at Moderate Redshift	Large photometric surveys with the aim of identifying many Type Ia supernovae (SNe) at moderate redshift are challenged in separating these SNe from other SN types. We are motivated to identify Type Ia SNe based only on broadband photometric information, since spectroscopic determination of the SN type, the traditional method, requires significant amounts of time on large telescopes. We consider the possible observables provided by a large synoptic photometry survey. We examine the optical colors and magnitudes of many SN types from z=0.1 to z=1.0, using space-based ultraviolet spectra and ground-based optical spectra to simulate the photometry. We also discuss the evolution of colors over the SN outburst and the use of host galaxy characteristics to aid in the identification of Type Ia SNe. We consider magnitudes in both the SDSS photometric system and in a proposed filter system with logarithmically spaced bandpasses. We find that photometric information in four bands covering the entire optical spectrum appears capable of providing identification of Type Ia SNe based on their colors at a single observed epoch soon after maximum light, even without independent estimates of the SN redshift. Very blue filters are extremely helpful, as at moderate redshift they sample the restframe ultraviolet spectrum where the SN types are very different. We emphasize the need for further observations of SNe in the restframe ultraviolet to fully characterize, refine, and improve this method of SN type identification.	5	2005

Seventy international learners of English were asked to fill in a questionnaire three times during one academic year in an international foundation program. An additional 10 students and two of their English language tutors were interviewed at the end of their study period. We analysed variations in language-learning motivation as well as in the frequency and type of contact the learners experienced at three distinct points of time during the international study programme. The results indicate that whereas written and media contact increased in frequency during the academic year, the participants engaged in less frequent spoken contact at the end of the period investigated. The qualitative and quantitative data show that contact experiences, socio-environmental factors and learner internal variables have a dynamic impact on each other and they together can play an important role in the language-learning experiences of international students.\nThe mixed-method study presented in this paper investigates the changes in direct and indirect intercultural contact and language-learning attitudes and effort of international students in the United Kingdom.

We find rather well-converged results in model spaces consisting of 15 oscillator shells, and the doubly magic nuclei 40Ca, 48Ca, and the exotic 48Ni are underbound by about 1 MeV per nucleon within the coupled-cluster singles-doubles approximation. The binding-energy difference between the mirror nuclei 48Ca and 48Ni is close to theoretical mass table evaluations. Our computation of the one-body density matrices and the corresponding natural orbitals and occupation numbers provides a first step to a microscopic foundation of the nuclear shell model.	12	2008
10.1111/j.1742-1241.2004.00318.x	0BB3B6AF	Avandamet: Combined metformin-rosiglitazone treatment for insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes	Insulin resistance is a major endocrinopathy underlying the development of hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes. Metformin (a biguanide) and rosiglitazone (a thiazolidinedione) counter insulin resistance, acting by different cellular mechanisms. The two agents can be used in combination to achieve additive glucose-lowering efficacy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, without stimulating insulin secretion and without causing hypoglycaemia. Both agents also reduce a range of atherothrombotic factors and markers, indicating a lower cardiovascular risk. Early intervention with metformin is already known to reduce myocardial infarction and increase survival in overweight type 2 patients. Recently, a single-tablet combination of metformin and rosiglitazone, Avandamet, has become available. Avandamet is suitable for type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled by monotherapy with metformin or rosiglitazone. Patients already receiving separate tablets of metformin and rosiglitazone may switch to the single-tablet combination for convenience. Also, early introduction of the combination before maximal titration of one agent can reduce side effects. Use of Avandamet requires attention to the precautions for both metformin and rosiglitazone, especially renal, cardiac and hepatic competence. In summary, Avandamet is a single-tablet metformin-rosiglitazone combination that doubly targets insulin resistance as therapy for hyperglycaemia and vascular risk in type 2 diabetes.	10	2004
10.4102/jsava.v70i4.782	0CE4B719	The effect of gestation and lactation on bone calcium, phosphorus and magnesium in dairy cows.	A study was conducted to monitor changes in cortical bone mineral in the dairy cow in response to demands of lactation and pregnancy using rib bone biopsies in serial sampling. Sixteen Friesian cows from the University dairy herd were used to collect 9 samples during the lactation period and 5 samples during the dry period. The data were analysed using a split-plot design analysis of variance. There were no significant (P > 0.05) differences in cortical bone phosphorus concentrations in rib bone during the lactation period, but calcium concentrations in cortical bone were significantly (P < 0.05) higher at parturition and during the first 30 days of lactation compared to the next 30 days and between 90 and 120 days. Results reported here indicate that the cow resorbs cortical bone during the middle of the lactation period and not during the periparturient period as previously thought. Magnesium concentrations were also significantly (P < 0.05) higher at the beginning of lactation compared to some of the other sampling times, but cortical bone was significantly (P < 0.05) thinner at the beginning of lactation compared to several of the other sampling times. There were no significant (P > 0.05) differences in cortical bone Ca or Mg concentrations during the gestation period. Cortical bone P concentrations significantly (P < 0.05) decreased during the first 180 days, but significantly (P < 0.05) increased at 181-230 days and significantly (P < 0.05) decreased again at 231 days to term. Cortical bone thickness decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from the beginning of gestation to term. There were no significant (P > 0.05) differences in cortical bone thickness or Ca or Mg concentrations in cortical bone during the dry period, but cortical bone P concentrations were significantly (P < 0.05) greater at the end of the dry period compared to the first 30 days of the period. In general, cortical bone Ca and Mg values decreased as milk production increased up to 20 kg/day and cortical bone P values and bone thickness increased. In animals producing over 20 kg/day, however, cortical bone mineral values were greater and cortical bone thickness was lower compared to those animals producing less than 20 kg.	2	1999
10.4103/0972-9941.129970	0B0A217A	Single incision laparoscopic surgery - trans anal endoscopic microsurgery: A technological innovation.	Trans anal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) first burst upon the scene several decades ago and then underwent a period of immersion. We have herein reported our experience in two cases who underwent TEM using laparoscopic techniques. The advent of single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has made great inroads into various fields of general and gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. We decided to make use of the same technique in TEM for two patients who had large sessile villous adenomas of the rectum. We used this port and fixed it transanally to the edge of the anus. Carbon dioxide used for insufflation in laparoscopic surgery was used through one of the ports, and a telescope was inserted to the larger port. We made sure that the entire polyp was cut out completely until the circular muscle of the internal sphincter was clearly exposed. Next, the cut edges of the rectum were undermined between the mucosa and the circular muscles in order to bring the cut edges closer together. We were able to perform this SILS TEM in two cases. In both the cases, well differentiated villous adenoma (colonoscopically, biopsy proven before surgery) was confirmed after excision. The question has been raised whether TEM is the new laparoscopy for anorectal surgery. Increasingly, several reports are showing promise for treatment for early stage cancers and large rectal adenomas using TEM. Adoption of our technique using the SILS port that has not been previously described in medical literature, seems to be a promising tool for the future. TEM first burst upon the scene several decades ago and then under went a period of immersion. In recent years, with the onset of laparoscopic surgery, the thoughts and the ideas of using a laparoscopic surgical technique have invaded the area of colorectal cancer as well. We have herein reported our experience in two cases who underwent TEM using laparoscopic techniques.	1	2014

Samples from 12 herds of four regions of Cordoba were analysed by starch gel electrophoresis. The chi 2 test was used to assess whether the populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genotypic diversity was analysed by the Shannon-Weaver index. The observed genotypic frequencies were analysed by Hedrick's genetic identity and the genetic distance of Balakrishnan and Sanghvi. The allelic and genotypic frequencies were similar to those of other Holstein populations. The genotypic frequencies of the alpha s1-casein and beta -casein loci were in equilibrium, whereas in some populations the kappa -casein and beta -lactoglobulin loci were not. According to the Shannon-Weaver index the total genetic diversity within each herd was greater than 96%. The high values of identity agreed with the low genetic distances among populations. We conclude that there is extensive genetic homogeneity in Holstein cattle in Cordoba Province and that it would be feasible to select for B alleles at the kappa -casein and beta -lactoglobulin loci in order to improve the quality of milk available for cheese manufacturing. 	7	2000
10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.06.042	03D19EA9	Characterizing hydraulic properties of filter material of a vertical flow constructed wetland	The filter material is a matrix of porous mineral material and organic matter that makes hydraulic characterization a difficult task. Here, we present a combined laboratory and in situ approach to assess the hydraulic properties of a VFCW installed at Evieu in Ain, France. The laboratory approach produces prior estimates of the local properties of the different VFCW system layers. These prior estimates are subsequently refined with inversely estimated parameters using the HYDRUS-1D code in combination with in situ hydrodynamic measurements. Laboratory experiments consisted of both direct (sand box, pressure chamber, and permeameter experiments) and inverse estimates (evaporation method) of hydraulic parameters. In situ measurements were based on 5.5-day monitoring of the full-scale filter using 24 time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes installed at different depths. Applying the methodology with successive optimizations led to a reliable assessment of the hydraulic parameters of the VFCW. We conclude that the consistent representation of the hydraulic behavior of the VFCW requires in situ hydrodynamic observations combined with inverse modeling. However, to avoid the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, the number of fitted parameters should be kept to a minimum and parameter initialization need to be based on local-scale laboratory measurements. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.	10	2013
10.1348/014466608X314935	04652955	Stereotype content model across cultures: towards universal similarities and some differences.	The stereotype content model (SCM) proposes potentially universal principles of societal stereotypes and their relation to social structure. Here, the SCM reveals theoretically grounded, cross-cultural, cross-groups similarities and one difference across 10 non-US nations. Seven European (individualist) and three East Asian (collectivist) nations (N=1,028) support three hypothesized cross-cultural similarities: (a) perceived warmth and competence reliably differentiate societal group stereotypes; (b) many out-groups receive ambivalent stereotypes (high on one dimension; low on the other); and (c) high status groups stereotypically are competent, whereas competitive groups stereotypically lack warmth. Data uncover one consequential cross-cultural difference: (d) the more collectivist cultures do not locate reference groups (in-groups and societal prototype groups) in the most positive cluster (high-competence/high-warmth), unlike individualist cultures. This demonstrates out-group derogation without obvious reference-group favouritism. The SCM can serve as a pancultural tool for predicting group stereotypes from structural relations with other groups in society, and comparing across societies.	259	2009

No acute toxicological sign was observed in animals treated with the highest dose (5000 mg/kg, p.o. or 2000 mg/kg i.p.) of EEOH. The extract doses of 250, 500 or 750 mg/kg revealed a significant inhibitory effect (P < 0.01) in carrageenin-induced rat paw oedema and exhibited ulcer-protective properties against ethanol-induced ulceration in rats. An anti-diarrhoeal activity (P < 0.01) was also observed in castor-oil-induced diarrhoeal in mice. The intestinal transit was significantly (P < 0.01) reduced, however the pretreatment did not reduce the weight of intestinal contents. These results support the popular applications of Maytenus rigida for the treatment of inflammation, ulcer and diarrhoea in Brazil herbal traditional medicine.	5	2007

10.3390/ma3042567	0A010510	Novel materials through non-hydrolytic sol-gel processing: Negative thermal expansion oxides and beyond	Low temperature methods have been applied to the synthesis of many advanced materials. Non-hydrolytic sol-gel (NHSG) processes offer an elegant route to stable and metastable phases at low temperatures. Excellent atomic level homogeneity gives access to polymorphs that are difficult or impossible to obtain by other methods. The NHSG approach is most commonly applied to the preparation of metal oxides, but can be easily extended to metal sulfides. Exploration of experimental variables allows control over product stoichiometry and crystal structure. This paper reviews the application of NHSG chemistry to the synthesis of negative thermal expansion oxides and selected metal sulfides.	27	2010

The asymmetries defined can be used to determine the imaginary part of the electric dipole form factors. A gamma-gamma collider with photon beams generated from laser back-scattering off electron beams with an integrated geometric luminosity of 20 fb^{-1} can put a limit of the order of 10^{-17} e cm on the imaginary part of the electric dipole form factor of the top quark if the electron beams have longitudinal polarization and the laser beams have circular polarization.	0	1997

All variants were investigated in case-control studies for MI (ECTIM: 990 cases, 900 controls) and brain infarction (BI) (GÉNIC: 466 cases, 444 controls). Promoter variants were functionally analyzed by bandshift assays, the coding D147D [T/C] by Western blot. Allele D147D C was independently and significantly associated with lower apoB levels (P = 0.044 [ECTIM] P = 0.03 [GENIC]), its allele frequency was significantly lower in patients with BI compared to controls (OR [95% CI] 0.39 [0.20-0.74], P = 0.004), and C allele carriers had a significantly lower frequency of presence of carotid plaques (P = 0.02). Bandshifts with HepG2 and Ea.hy926 nuclear proteins did not reveal any functionality of promoter variants, whereas the OPN-441C-containing construct resulted in reduced OPN protein expression in Western blots, complying with its potential protective effect on the phenotypes studied.We here provide evidence that a portion of the OPN locus is likely to associate with cardiovascular disease-related phenotypes. However, further experiments are warranted to clarify the functional role of OPN variants. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.	5	2009
10.1109/TAC.2004.826719	041D54C4	The application of dynamic programming to optimal inventory control	 This paper concerns a class of deterministic impulse control problems, arising in inventory control. A notable feature of the problem formulation is the presence of an end-point constraint. In consequence, the value function may be discontinuous. Viability theory provides a characterization of the value function as the unique lower semicontinuous solution to a Bensoussan-Lions type quasi-variational inequality (QVI), suitably interpreted for nondifferentiable, extended valued functions. Yet there are few examples in the literature of the use of this analytical machinery. This paper provides such an example. The example, which concerns a problem for which the value function is neither everywhere finite valued nor continuously differentiable on the interior of its effective domain, illustrates what is involved in calculating subdifferentials and checking satisfaction of QVI (in a generalized sense). This paper also provides a summary of the underlying theory, and gathers in the Appendix proofs of key results.	1	2004
10.1080/09518960500204657	145F87EF	A Newsletter in 1419? Antonio Morosini's Chronicle in the Light of Commercial Correspondence between Venice and Alexandria	While studying Venetian trade in Alexandria, I discovered a hitherto unknown letter in the State Archives of Venice which sheds light on the activities of the Venetian diarist Antonio Morosini and his chronicle. The letter is in Morosini's own hand and directed to his nephew, serving as Venetian consul in Alexandria. It deals mainly with political and military subjects and is therefore very different from the typical merchant letters of the period. Other letters directed to the same consul reveal the singular character of Morosini's; apart from its first and last paragraphs it seems to be almost an early form of newsletter or <span class="roman">avviso</span>. According to established opinion, the newsletter came into being only at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Therefore, the study of this letter has far-reaching consequences not only for research on Morosini's chronicle, on which this and several other merchant letters cast new light, but also for the history of news production and diffusion in general.	4	2005
10.1186/1471-2105-7-466	021A5F89	ProFAT: a web-based tool for the functional annotation of protein sequences.	BACKGROUND: The functional annotation of proteins relies on published information concerning their close and remote homologues in sequence databases. Evidence for remote sequence similarity can be further strengthened by a similar biological background of the query sequence and identified database sequences. However, few tools exist so far, that provide a means to include functional information in sequence database searches. RESULTS: We present ProFAT, a web-based tool for the functional annotation of protein sequences based on remote sequence similarity. ProFAT combines sensitive sequence database search methods and a fold recognition algorithm with a simple text-mining approach. ProFAT extracts identified hits based on their biological background by keyword-mining of annotations, features and most importantly, literature associated with a sequence entry. A user-provided keyword list enables the user to specifically search for weak, but biologically relevant homologues of an input query. The ProFAT server has been evaluated using the complete set of proteins from three different domain families, including their weak relatives and could correctly identify between 90% and 100% of all domain family members studied in this context. ProFAT has furthermore been applied to a variety of proteins from different cellular contexts and we provide evidence on how ProFAT can help in functional prediction of proteins based on remotely conserved proteins. CONCLUSION: By employing sensitive database search programs as well as exploiting the functional information associated with database sequences, ProFAT can detect remote, but biologically relevant relationships between proteins and will assist researchers in the prediction of protein function based on remote homologies.	19	2006

Methods This is a retrospective case-control study, performed at the Gynecologic Oncologic Unit, National Cancer Institute "Regina Elena", Rome, and at the Gynecologic Oncologic Unit, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy between December 2011 and January 2013. Results 19 women underwent RSS-H (cases) and 38 patients were submitted to LESS-H (controls) for early endometrial cancer. Pre-surgical procedures (port placement and docking) required a median time of 8 min in the RSS-H group and a median time of 2 min in the LESS-H group (p = 0.0001). The median estimated blood loss was 75 ml in the cases and 30 ml in the controls (p = 0.005). The median operative time, calculated from the beginning of intraperitoneal procedures to the skin closure, was 90 min in the cases and 107 ml in the controls (p = ns). The median time to discharge from the hospital was postoperative day two for both techniques. Conclusions The few differences we registered do not seem clinically relevant, thus making the two procedures comparable. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.	2	2013
10.1186/1759-8753-2-12	033AABFD	Crypton transposons: identification of new diverse families and ancient domestication events	BACKGROUND: "Domestication" of transposable elements (TEs) led to evolutionary breakthroughs such as the origin of telomerase and the vertebrate adaptive immune system. These breakthroughs were accomplished by the adaptation of molecular functions essential for TEs, such as reverse transcription, DNA cutting and ligation or DNA binding. Cryptons represent a unique class of DNA transposons using tyrosine recombinase (YR) to cut and rejoin the recombining DNA molecules. Cryptons were originally identified in fungi and later in the sea anemone, sea urchin and insects.\n\nRESULTS: Herein we report new Cryptons from animals, fungi, oomycetes and diatom, as well as widely conserved genes derived from ancient Crypton domestication events. Phylogenetic analysis based on the YR sequences supports four deep divisions of Crypton elements. We found that the domain of unknown function 3504 (DUF3504) in eukaryotes is derived from Crypton YR. DUF3504 is similar to YR but lacks most of the residues of the catalytic tetrad (R-H-R-Y). Genes containing the DUF3504 domain are potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 1 (KCTD1), KIAA1958, zinc finger MYM type 2 (ZMYM2), ZMYM3, ZMYM4, glutamine-rich protein 1 (QRICH1) and "without children" (WOC). The DUF3504 genes are highly conserved and are found in almost all jawed vertebrates. The sequence, domain structure, intron positions and synteny blocks support the view that ZMYM2, ZMYM3, ZMYM4, and possibly QRICH1, were derived from WOC through two rounds of genome duplication in early vertebrate evolution. WOC is observed widely among bilaterians. There could be four independent events of Crypton domestication, and one of them, generating WOC/ZMYM, predated the birth of bilaterian animals. This is the third-oldest domestication event known to date, following the domestication generating telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and Prp8. Many Crypton-derived genes are transcriptional regulators with additional DNA-binding domains, and the acquisition of the DUF3504 domain could have added new regulatory pathways via protein-DNA or protein-protein interactions.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Cryptons have contributed to animal evolution through domestication of their YR sequences. The DUF3504 domains are domesticated YRs of animal Crypton elements.	23	2011
10.1016/j.enpol.2007.06.007	0AD73AE2	Market risks and oilfield ownership-Refining oil and gas disclosures	Market risk exposures of balance sheet asset values are becoming an increasingly important accounting issue. In oil and gas, oilfield exposures to oil prices are specific and contractual, presenting a contingency problem for investors, financial analysts, standard setting bodies and government agencies. Our paper uses an extensive sample of 292 oilfields to provide evidence that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supplementary disclosures do not capture the price sensitivities of oil and gas disclosures implicit in the two main forms of oilfield ownership, concession and production sharing contracts (PSCs). Current asset disclosures neither distinguish between global variations in oilfield ownership terms, nor on market risk implications for the value of oilfield assets. Importantly, we show that unlike concessions, reserve and production disclosures vary in response to oil price movements for PSC regimes. Our results highlight the need to differentiate PSC disclosures from concession fields, and to fully reflect price risks implicit in oilfield ownership contracts. We extend findings by Rajgopal [1999. Early evidence on the informativeness of the SEC's market risk disclosures: the case of commodity price risk exposure of oil and gas producers.

10.1186/1475-2859-11-107	007D16D3	Development of new plasmid DNA vaccine vectors with R1-based replicons	BACKGROUND: There has been renewed interest in biopharmaceuticals based on plasmid DNA (pDNA) in recent years due to the approval of several veterinary DNA vaccines, on-going clinical trials of human pDNA-based therapies, and significant advances in adjuvants and delivery vehicles that have helped overcome earlier efficacy deficits. With this interest comes the need for high-yield, cost-effective manufacturing processes. To this end, vector engineering is one promising strategy to improve plasmid production.\n\nRESULTS: In this work, we have constructed a new DNA vaccine vector, pDMB02-GFP, containing the runaway R1 origin of replication. The runaway replication phenotype should result in plasmid copy number amplification after a temperature shift from 30°C to 42°C. However, using Escherichia coli DH5α as a host, we observed that the highest yields of pDMB02-GFP were achieved during constant-temperature culture at 30°C, with a maximum yield of approximately 19 mg pDNA/g DCW being observed. By measuring mRNA and protein levels of the R1 replication initiator protein, RepA, we determined that RepA may be limiting pDMB02-GFP yield at 42°C. A mutant plasmid, pDMB-ATG, was constructed by changing the repA start codon from the sub-optimal GTG to ATG. In cultures of DH5α[pDMB-ATG], temperature-induced plasmid amplification was more dramatic than that observed with pDMB02-GFP, and RepA protein was detectable for several hours longer than in cultures of pDMB02-GFP at 42°C.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, we have demonstrated that R1-based plasmids can produce high yields of high-quality pDNA without the need for a temperature shift, and have laid the groundwork for further investigation of this class of vectors in the context of plasmid DNA production.	13	2012

10.3389/fneur.2013.00068	04AC77F6	The serendipity case of the pedunculopontine nucleus low-frequency brain stimulation: Chasing a gait response, finding sleep, and cognition improvement	Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an efficacious therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) but its effects on non-motor facets may be detrimental. The low-frequency stimulation (LFS) of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN or the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontini - PPTg-) opened new perspectives. In our hands, PPTg-LFS revealed a modest influence on gait but increased sleep quality and degree of attentiveness. At odds with potential adverse events following STN-DBS, executive functions, under PPTg-ON, ameliorated. A recent study comparing both targets found that only PPTg-LFS improved night-time sleep and daytime sleepiness. Chances are that different neurosurgical groups influence either the PPN sub-portion identified as pars dissipata (more interconnected with GPi/STN) or the caudal PPN region known as pars compacta, preferentially targeting intralaminar and associative nucleus of the thalamus. Yet, the wide electrical field delivered affects a plethora of en passant circuits, and a fine distinction on the specific pathways involved is elusive. This review explores our angle of vision, by which PPTg-LFS activates cholinergic and glutamatergic ascending fibers, influencing non-motor behaviors.	20	2013
10.1086/338987	09822822	Resolved Near-Infrared Spectroscopy of the Mysterious Pre-Main Sequence Binary Systems T Tau S	We obtained new near-infrared images of the prototypical pre-main sequence triple system T Tau, as well as the first resolved medium-resolution spectra of the close pair T Tau S. At the time of our observations, the tight binary had a 13 AU projected separation and showed significant motion since its discovery, three years before. The orbit cannot be strongly constrained yet, but the observed motion of T Tau Sb with respect to T Tau Sa suggests that the system is at least as massive as T Tau N itself. This may indicate that T Tau N is not the most massive star in the system. The spectrum of T Tau Sa, which is totally featureless except for a strong Br gamma emission line, identifies this component with the ``infrared companion'', whose exact nature remains obscure but may be the consequence of it being the most massive component of the system. Contrasting sharply with T Tau Sa, the spectrum of T Tau Sb shows numerous photospheric features consistent with an early-M spectral type. The presence of a strong Br gamma emission line and of a significant veiling continuum classifies this object as a deeply embedded T Tauri star. From these observations, we conclude that both components of T Tau S are embedded in their own dense circumstellar cocoon of material, which are probably fed by a much more extended structure.	0	2001

10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.056804	09ACE0D4	Incipient formation of an electron lattice in a weakly confined quantum wire	We study the low-temperature transport properties of 1D quantum wires as the confinement strength V_{conf} and the carrier density n_{1D} are varied using a combination of split gates and a top gate in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. At intermediate V_{conf} and n_{1D}, we observe a jump in conductance to 4e;{2}/h, suggesting a double wire. On further reducing n_{1D}, plateau at 2e;{2}/h returns. Our results show beginnings of the formation of an electron lattice in an interacting quasi-1D quantum wire. In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, mixing of spin-aligned levels of the two wires gives rise to more complex states.	41	2009
10.1103/PhysRevD.60.104016	085C03DC	Dyonic Non-Abelian Black Holes	We study static spherically symmetric dyonic black holes in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. As for the magnetic non-abelian black holes, the domain of existence of the dyonic non-abelian black holes is limited with respect to the horizon radius and the dimensionless coupling constant $\alpha$, which is proportional to the ratio of vector meson mass and Planck mass. At a certain critical value of this coupling constant, $\hat \alpha$, the maximal horizon radius is attained. We derive analytically a relation between $\hat \alpha$ and the charge of the black hole solutions and confirm this relation numerically. Besides the fundamental dyonic non-abelian black holes, we study radially excited dyonic non-abelian black holes and globally regular gravitating dyons.	2	1999

10.1128/JB.01639-12	10E69904	Ferric-pyoverdine recognition by Fpv outer membrane proteins of pseudomonas protegens pf-5	The soil bacterium Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 (previously called P. fluorescens Pf-5) produces two siderophores, enantio-pyochelin and a compound in the large and diverse pyoverdine family. Using high-resolution mass spectroscopy, we determined the structure of the pyoverdine produced by Pf-5. In addition to producing its own siderophores, Pf-5 also utilizes ferric complexes of some pyoverdines produced by other strains of Pseudomonas spp. as sources of iron. Previously, phylogenetic analysis of the 45 TonB-dependent outer membrane proteins in Pf-5 indicated that six are in a well-supported clade with ferric-pyoverdine receptors (Fpvs) from other Pseudomonas spp. We used a combination of phylogenetics, bioinformatics, mutagenesis, pyoverdine structural determinations, and cross-feeding bioassays to assign specific ferric-pyoverdine substrates to each of the six Fpvs of Pf-5. We identified at least one ferric-pyoverdine that was taken up by each of the six Fpvs of Pf-5. Functional redundancy of the Pf-5 Fpvs was also apparent, with some ferric-pyoverdines taken up by all mutants with a single Fpv deletion but not by a mutant having deletions in two of the Fpv-encoding genes. Finally, we demonstrated that phylogenetically related Fpvs take up ferric complexes of structurally related pyoverdines, thereby establishing structure-function relationships that can be employed in the future to predict the pyoverdine substrates of Fpvs in other Pseudomonas spp.	9	2013

10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.08494.x	051A251D	Avoidable iatrogenic complications of urethral catheterization and inadequate intern training in a tertiary-care teaching hospital	OBJECTIVE: To examine the magnitude of potentially avoidable iatrogenic complications of male urethral catheterization (UC) within a tertiary-care supra-regional teaching hospital, and to evaluate risk factors and subjective feeling of interns in our institution on the adequacy of training on UC. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Male UC-related morbidities were retrospectively identified from our computerized inpatient urology consultation system over a 1-year period from July 2006 to June 2007. Relevant medical records were also reviewed. An anonymous questionnaire was used for the subjective assessment of interns about their training on UC. The primary outcome measures were the prevalence of urethral trauma secondary to UC by a non-urological team member in non-urological departments, risk factors and intern-perceived adequacy of practical and theoretical training on UC during their intern year, and finally the supervision of interns during first UC. RESULTS: Of 864 urological consultations, 51 (6%) were related to complications arising from male UC during the 1-year period. The most common indication for UC was monitoring urinary output for acute medical illness (34/51, 67%). The most common complication was urethral trauma (35/51, 67%). The balloon was accidentally inflated in the urethra in six patients (12%). Of the 51 cases of UC-related morbidity, 38 (74%) resulted from interns performing UC, and of these 28 (73%) occurred during the first 6 months of internship. Overall, 76% of interns felt that their practical training was none or inadequate; 52% (26/50) did not receive any supervision during their first UC. CONCLUSIONS: UC-related iatrogenic morbidity is not uncommon even in a tertiary-care teaching hospital. This study identified that interns receive inadequate training on UC. Finally, most of the complications are potentially avoidable and can be prevented by adopting a proper technique of catheterization. Adequate training and supervision of medical students and interns can achieve this.	13	2009
10.1186/1476-7961-10-1	0752F4DD	The usefulness of casein-specific IgE and IgG4 antibodies in cow's milk allergic children	BACKGROUND: Cow's milk allergy is one of the most common food allergies among younger children. We investigated IgE antibodies to milk, and IgE and IgG4 antibodies to casein, α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin in cow's milk allergic (CMA) and non-allergic (non-CMA) children in order to study their clinical usefulness.\n\nMETHODS: Eighty-three children with suspected milk allergy (median age: 3.5 years, range: 0.8-15.8 years) were diagnosed as CMA (n = 61) or non-CMA (n = 22) based on an open milk challenge or convincing clinical history. Their serum concentrations of allergen-specific (s) IgE and IgG4 antibodies were measured using ImmunoCAP®. For the sIgG4 analysis, 28 atopic and 31 non-atopic control children were additionally included (all non-milk sensitized).\n\nRESULTS: The CMA group had significantly higher levels of milk-, casein- and β-lactoglobulin-sIgE antibodies as compared to the non-CMA group. The casein test showed the best discriminating performance with a clinical decision point of 6.6 kUA/L corresponding to 100% specificity. All but one of the CMA children aged > 5 years had casein-sIgE levels > 6.6 kUA/L. The non-CMA group had significantly higher sIgG4 levels against all three milk allergens compared to the CMA group. This was most pronounced for casein-sIgG4 in non-CMA children without history of previous milk allergy. These children had significantly higher casein-sIgG4 levels compared to any other group, including the non-milk sensitized control children.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: High levels of casein-sIgE antibodies are strongly associated with milk allergy in children and might be associated with prolonged allergy. Elevated casein-sIgG4 levels in milk-sensitized individuals on normal diet indicate a modified Th2 response. However, the protective role of IgG4 antibodies in milk allergy is unclear.	13	2012

10.1016/j.ces.2013.11.011	0056227A	A cascaded pervaporation process for dehydration of acetic acid	Pervaporation is advantageous in separating close-boiling point mixtures, azeotropes, thermally sensitive compounds and purification of chemicals. However, one pervaporation unit may not be economically feasible to simultaneously provide a high purity of compounds in both the retentate and the permeate streams. In this study, a cascaded pervaporation method is developed aiming to dehydrate 85. wt% acetic acid solution from a basis feed of 100. kg/h. First, pervaporation experiments were performed using lab-made PPSU membranes. In pervaporation, the separation factor depends on the intrinsic properties of the membrane and on the operating conditions. These aspects cause a variation of the separation factor in pervaporation from 2 to 24. The process with one pervaporation unit, a cascaded PV system, and a cascaded PV with recycle stream is evaluated. This study demonstrates an efficient dewatering of acetic acid from an initial feed of 85. wt% acetic acid, obtaining 99.7. wt% acetic acid at rate of 72.8. kg/h using a cascaded PV with recycle stream. The large membrane area requirement in PV due to the low flux may be the main limitation for PV. Therefore, the development of new membranes exhibiting a high flux and a high selectivity are vital to decrease the membrane area, which may improve the potential for realizing these processes on a commercial scale. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.	6	2014
10.1016/j.apcata.2011.12.042	05F0D089	Optimization of the preparation procedure of cobalt modified silicas as catalysts in methanol decomposition	Novel modified "chemisorption-hydrolysis" technique and conventional "incipient wetness impregnation" procedure were compared for loading of cobalt species on mesoporous silica supports. Effect of cobalt amount, pH of the precursor solution, duration of the "chemisorption" procedure and pre-treatment medium, as well as topological characteristics of the mesoporous silica support were investigated. The state of the loaded cobalt species was studied by XRD, FTIR, FTIR of adsorbed pyridine, UV-vis, XPS and TPR methods and their catalytic properties were elucidated in methanol decomposition to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The "incipient wetness impregnation" technique facilitates the formation of finely dispersed spinel cobalt oxide species. Their catalytic activity could be significantly increased by hydrogen pretreatment, but the effect is more pronounced when mesoporous silica with ordered pseudo 1D pore structure (SBA-15) is used as a support. The modified "chemisorption-hydrolysis" procedure facilitates the formation of strongly interacting with the support cobalt species, which are stable under the reduction conditions. Their properties could be regulated during the modification procedure, by varying the cobalt content and pH of the impregnated solution as well as by the duration of the "chemisorption" procedure. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

10.1109/ICPR.2006.806	0B4BDC92	Modelling crowd scenes for event detection	This work presents an automatic technique for detection of abnormal events in crowds. Crowd behaviour is difficult to predict and might not be easily semantically translated. Moreover it is difficulty to track individuals in the crowd using state of the art tracking algorithms. Therefore we characterise crowd behaviour by observing the crowd optical flow and use unsupervised feature extraction to encode normal crowd behaviour. The unsupervised feature extraction applies spectral clustering to find the optimal number of models to represent normal motion patterns. The motion models are HMMs to cope with the variable number of motion samples that might be present in each observation window. The results on simulated crowds demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for detecting crowd emergency scenarios	95	2006

10.1038/nm.2110	066E7A53	T helper type 1 and 17 cells determine efficacy of interferon-beta in multiple sclerosis and experimental encephalomyelitis.	Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) is the major treatment for multiple sclerosis. However, this treatment is not always effective. Here we have found congruence in outcome between responses to IFN-beta in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). IFN-beta was effective in reducing EAE symptoms induced by T helper type 1 (T(H)1) cells but exacerbated disease induced by T(H)17 cells. Effective treatment in T(H)1-induced EAE correlated with increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) production by splenocytes. In T(H)17-induced disease, the amount of IL-10 was unaltered by treatment, although, unexpectedly, IFN-beta treatment still reduced IL-17 production without benefit. Both inhibition of IL-17 and induction of IL-10 depended on IFN-gamma. In the absence of IFN-gamma signaling, IFN-beta therapy was ineffective in EAE. In RRMS patients, IFN-beta nonresponders had higher IL-17F concentrations in serum compared to responders. Nonresponders had worse disease with more steroid usage and more relapses than did responders. Hence, IFN-beta is proinflammatory in T(H)17-induced EAE. Moreover, a high IL-17F concentration in the serum of people with RRMS is associated with nonresponsiveness to therapy with IFN-beta.	157	2010

Cancer research has mainly focused on alterations of genes and proteins in cancer cells themselves that result in either gain-of-function in oncogenes or loss-of-function in tumour-suppressor genes. However, stromal variables within or around tumours, including blood and lymph vessels, stromal cells and various proteins, have also important impacts on tumour development and progression. It has been shown that disruption of stromal-epithelial interactions influences cellular proliferation, differentiation, death, motility, genomic integrity, angiogenesis, and other phenotypes in various tissues. Moreover, stromal variables are also critical to therapy in cancer patients. In this review, we mainly focus on the clinicopathological significance of stromal variables including angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, inflammatory infiltration, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and the particularly interesting new cysteine-histidine rich protein (PINCH) in colorectal cancer (CRC).	16	2006

10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.06.009	07D6AEE7	Effect of structured lipids based on fish oil on the growth and fatty acid composition in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)	The aim of the study was to investigate whether it was possible a) to increase the relative incorporation of n - 3 very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFA) in a low VLCPUFA diet by feeding trout structured triacylglycerols and b) to reduce fat accumulation by feeding trout a diet containing DAG. A feeding experiment where groups of rainbow trout were fed six diets containing different types of oils for 61 days was performed. The lipid fraction of the six diets was as follows: 1) Fish oil and rapeseed oil (FO diet), 2) Specific structured lipid and rapeseed oil (SL diet), 3) Randomised structured lipids and rapeseed oil (RL diet), 4) Medium chain triglyceride and fish oil (MCT diet), 5) Diacylglycerol and fish oil (DAG diet), 6) Fish oil (FOmax diet). Five of the diets (1-5) contained mixed oils blended to contain the same amount of EPA and DHA. Three of these diets (2,3 and 4) contained medium chain fatty acids incorporated in TAG to be positioned either intentionally as specific (SL), by chance as randomised (RL) or added as medium chain TAG (MCT). Diet 1 contained fish oil (FO) in order to investigate the effect of MCFA and diet 4 contained diacylglycerol (DAG). Diet 6) was a reference diet containing pure fish oil (FOmax). After the feeding period, FO and FOmax fed fish were significantly larger than SL fed fish. Digestibility, measured by adding yttrium oxide as inert marker was significantly lowest for the MCT diet. Fish on the RL and MCT diets had significantly higher protein contents than fish fed FO and FOmax diets. The total fatty acid compositions of the fillet, liver, carcass and viscera were similar and reflected closely that of the diet, also in the sn-2 position. In conclusion, addition of MCT to the diet increased protein content of the fish. There was no additional effect of incorporating the medium chain fatty acids in specific positions and no weight reducing effect of adding DAG to the diets. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

10.1016/j.peptides.2004.12.002	04B0BABA	Molecular cloning of a novel putative potassium channel-blocking neurotoxin from the venom of the North African scorpion, Androctonus amoreuxi	Scorpion venoms are a particularly rich source of neurotoxic proteins/peptides that interact in a highly specific fashion with discrete subtypes of ion channels in excitable and non-excitable cells. Here we have employed a recently developed technique to effect molecular cloning and structural characterization of a novel putative potassium channel-blocking toxin from the same sample of venom from the North African scorpion, Androctonus amoreuxi. The deduced precursor open-reading frame is composed of 59 amino acid residues that consists of a signal peptide of approximately 22 amino acid residues followed by a mature toxin of 37 amino acid residues. The mature toxin contains two functionally important residues (Lys                         27 and Tyr                          36), constituting a functional dyad motif that may be critical for potassium channel-blocking activity that can be affirmed from structural homologs as occurring in the venoms from other species of Androctonus scorpions. Parallel proteomic/transcriptomic studies can thus be performed on the same scorpion venom sample without sacrifice of the donor animal. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.	9	2005

10.1371/journal.pone.0033705	08C418B7	Risk factors and outcomes of candidemia caused by biofilm-forming isolates in a tertiary care hospital	BACKGROUND: Very few data exist on risk factors for developing biofilm-forming Candida bloodstream infection (CBSI) or on variables associated with the outcome of patients treated for this infection.\n\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: We identified 207 patients with CBSI, from whom 84 biofilm-forming and 123 non biofilm-forming Candida isolates were recovered. A case-case-control study to identify risk factors and a cohort study to analyze outcomes were conducted. In addition, two sub-groups of case patients were analyzed after matching for age, sex, APACHE III score, and receipt of adequate antifungal therapy. Independent predictors of biofilm-forming CBSI were presence of central venous catheter (odds ratio [OR], 6.44; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.21-12.92) or urinary catheter (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.18-4.91), use of total parenteral nutrition (OR, 5.21; 95% CI, 2.59-10.48), and diabetes mellitus (OR, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.03-9.83). Hospital mortality, post-CBSI hospital length of stay (LOS) (calculated only among survivors), and costs of antifungal therapy were significantly greater among patients infected by biofilm-forming isolates than those infected by non-biofilm-forming isolates. Among biofilm-forming CBSI patients receiving adequate antifungal therapy, those treated with highly active anti-biofilm (HAAB) agents (e.g., caspofungin) had significantly shorter post-CBSI hospital LOS than those treated with non-HAAB antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole); this difference was confirmed when this analysis was conducted only among survivors. After matching, all the outcomes were still favorable for patients with non-biofilm-forming CBSI. Furthermore, the biofilm-forming CBSI was significantly associated with a matched excess risk for hospital death of 1.77 compared to non-biofilm-forming CBSI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data show that biofilm growth by Candida has an adverse impact on clinical and economic outcomes of CBSI. Of note, better outcomes were seen for those CBSI patients who received HAAB antifungal therapy.	23	2012

10.1103/PhysRevD.64.074511	05EF0B12	Preliminaries on a lattice analysis of the pion light-cone wave function: A partonic signal?	We present the first attempt of a new method to compute the pion light-cone wave function (LCWF) on the lattice. We compute the matrix element between the pion and the vacuum of a non-local operator: the propagator of a ``scalar quark'' (named for short "squark"). A theoretical analysis shows that for some kinematical conditions (energetic pion and hard squark) this matrix element depends dominantly on the LCWF $\Phi_\pi(u), u\in [0,1]$. On the lattice, the discretization of the parton momenta imposes further constraints on the pion momentum. The two-point Green functions made of squark-quark and squark-squark fields show hadron-like bound-state behaviour and verify the standard energy spectrum. We show some indications that during a short time, after being created, the system of the spectator quark and the squark behave like partons, before they form a hadron-like bound state. This short time is the place where the partonic wave function has to be looked for.	0	2001

10.1186/1477-7827-1-85	0142808F	Temporal and spatial expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1 and 2 (TIMP-1 and -2) in the bovine corpus luteum.	The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), may mediate the dramatic structural and functional changes in the corpus luteum (CL) over the course of its life span. In addition to regulating MMP activity, TIMPs are also involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation and steroidogenesis. In a series of initial studies, we determined that matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory activity was present in protein extracts from early (4 days old, estrus = day 0), mid (10-12 days old) and late (16 days old) CL (n = 3 for each stage). Reverse zymography revealed four metalloproteinase inhibitory protein bands with relative molecular masses that are consistent with those reported for TIMP-1 to -4. In order to gain a better understanding of TIMPs and their role in luteal function, we further characterized this inhibitory activity with a particular focus on the temporal and spatial expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in the bovine CL. Northern blotting revealed that the TIMP-1 transcript (0.9 kb) was expressed at a higher (p < 0.05) level in early and mid cycle CL than in the late stage. In contrast, two TIMP-2 mRNA species, one major 1 kb species and one minor 3.5 kb species, were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in the mid and late cycle CL than in the early. Western blotting analyses demonstrated no differences in TIMP-1 (29 kDa) protein levels between early and mid stages, while its levels decreased (p < 0.05) from the mid to late stage CL. Conversely, TIMP-2 (22 kDa) protein was detected at a low level in the early CL, but significantly (p < 0.05) increased in the mid and late stages. Immunohistochemistry revealed that both TIMP-1 and -2 were localized to large luteal cells from all three ages of CL. TIMP-1 was also localized in capillary smooth muscle cells, while TIMP-2 was restricted to the endothelial cells in the capillary compartment. In conclusion, the different temporal expression patterns of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 suggest that TIMP-1 may be important for luteal formation and development, while TIMP-2 may play significant roles during luteal development and maintenance. Furthermore, the distinct localization of these two inhibitors in the vascular compartment indicates that they may serve diverse physiological functions during different stages of luteal angiogenesis.	1	2003

Data From the CHARM Program and the Duke Databank	Objectives: The goal of this study was to identify potentially novel laboratory markers of risk in chronic heart failure patients. Background: Although a variety of prognostic markers have been described in heart failure, a systematic assessment of routine laboratory values has not been reported. Methods: All 2,679 symptomatic chronic heart failure patients from the North American CHARM (Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity) program had a wide range of laboratory measures performed at a core facility, enabling us to assess the relationship between routine blood tests and outcomes using a Cox proportional hazards model. We then replicated our findings in a cohort of 2,140 heart failure patients from the Duke Databank. Results: Among 36 laboratory values considered in the CHARM program, higher red cell distribution width (RDW) showed the greatest association with morbidity and mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.17 per 1-SD increase, p < 0.001). Higher RDW was among the most powerful overall predictors, with only age and cardiomegaly showing a better independent association with outcome. This finding was replicated in the Duke Databank, in which higher RDW was strongly associated with all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.29 per 1 SD, p < 0.001), second only to age as a predictor of outcome. Conclusions: In 2 large contemporary heart failure populations, RDW was found to be a very strong independent predictor of morbidity and mortality. Understanding how and why this marker is associated with outcome may provide novel insights into heart failure pathophysiology. © 2007 American College of Cardiology Foundation.	45	2007
10.1046/j.1365-8711.1999.02960.x	078F7BFE	Cosmological parameters from cluster abundances, CMB and IRAS	We combine information on cosmological parameters from cluster abundances, CMB primordial anisotropies and the IRAS 1.2 Jy galaxy redshift survey. We take as free parameters the present values of the total matter density of the universe, Omega_m, the Hubble parameter, h, sigma_8, and the IRAS biasing factor, b_IRAS. We assume that the universe is spatially flat, with a cosmological constant, and that structure formed from adiabatic initial fluctuations with a Harrison-Zel'dovich power spectrum. The nucleosynthesis value Omega_b=0.019/h^2 is adopted. We use the full three- and four- dimensional likelihood functions for each data set and marginalise these to two- and one- dimensional distributions in a Bayesian way, integrating over the other parameters. It is shown that the three data sets are in excellent agreement, with a best fit point of Omega_m= 1-Omega_Lambda=0.36, h=0.54, sigma_8=0.74, and b_IRAS=1.08. This point is within one sigma of the minimum for each data set alone. Pairs of these data sets have their degeneracies in sufficiently different directions that using only two data sets at a time is sufficient to place good constraints on the cosmological parameters. We show that the results from each of the three possible pairings of the data are also in good agreement. Finally, we combine all three data sets to obtain marginalised 68 per cent confidence intervals of 0.30<Omega_m<0.43, 0.48<h<0.59, 0.69<sigma_8<0.79, and 1.01<b_IRAS<1.16. For the best fit parameters the CMB quadrupole is Q_rms-ps=18.0 uK, Gamma=0.15, Omega_b=0.066 and the age of the universe is 16.7 Gyr.	1	1999
10.1128/AEM.71.12.7819-7830.2005	006D5D74	Microbial diversity in coastal subsurface sediments: A cultivation approach using various electron acceptors and substrate gradients	Microbial communities in coastal subsurface sediments are scarcely investigated and have escaped attention so far. But since they are likely to play an important role in biogeochemical cycles, knowledge of their composition and ecological adaptations is important. Microbial communities in tidal sediments were investigated along the geochemical gradients from the surface down to a depth of 5.5 m. Most-probable-number (MPN) series were prepared with a variety of different carbon substrates, each at a low concentration, in combination with different electron acceptors such as iron and manganese oxides. These achieved remarkably high cultivation efficiencies (up to 23% of the total cell counts) along the upper 200 cm. In the deeper sediment layers, MPN counts dropped significantly. Parallel to the liquid enrichment cultures in the MPN series, gradient cultures with embedded sediment subcores were prepared as an additional enrichment approach. In total, 112 pure cultures were isolated; they could be grouped into 53 different operational taxonomic units (OTU). The isolates belonged to the Proteobacteria, "Bacteroidetes," "Fusobacteria," Actinobacteria, and "Firmicutes." Each cultivation approach yielded a specific set of isolates that in general were restricted to this single isolation procedure. Analysis of the enrichment cultures by PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed an even higher diversity in the primary enrichments that was only partially reflected by the culture collection. The majority of the isolates grew well under anoxic conditions, by fermentation, or by anaerobic respiration with nitrate, sulfate, ferrihydrite, or manganese oxides as electron acceptors.	76	2005

10.1186/1471-2466-4-10	0C6654CA	Tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma masquerading asthma: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Tracheal tumors are often misdiagnosed as asthma and are treated with inhaled steroids and bronchodilators without resolution. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, a patient with tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma who had been previously diagnosed with difficult asthma was reported. The possibility of the presence of localized airway obstruction was raised when the flow-volume curve suggesting fixed airway obstruction, was obtained. CONCLUSION: The presenting case report emphasizes the fact that not all wheezes are asthma. It is critical to bear in mind that if a patient does not respond to appropriate anti-asthma therapy, localized obstructions should be ruled out before establishing the diagnosis of asthma.	1	2004

10.1103/PhysRevA.89.063808	04234CE8	Nonlinear photon subtraction from a multimode quantum field	We consider theoretically how to extract mode dependent single photons from a time/frequency multimode non-classical beam. To achieve this task, we calculate the properties of sum frequency generation with a pulse shaped pump, taking into account both temporal and spatial degree of freedom. We show that using a non-collinear configuration it is possible to achieve a mode dependent weakly reflective beam splitter, with Schmidt number compatible with photon extraction for continuous variable regime tasks. We explicit the possible application to the degaussification of highly multimode squeezed frequency combs.	17	2014

Production of antihydrogen atoms by mixing antiprotons with a cold, confined, positron plasma depends critically on parameters such as the plasma density and temperature. We discuss nondestructive measurements, based on a novel, real-time analysis of excited, low-order plasma modes, that provide comprehensive characterization of the positron plasma in the ATHENA antihydrogen apparatus. The plasma length, radius, density, and total particle number are obtained. Measurement and control of plasma temperature variations, and the application to antihydrogen production experiments are discussed.	8	2003
10.3389/fendo.2012.00081	0B1DF1B9	Thyroid cancer cell lines: Critical models to study thyroid cancer biology and new therapeutic targets	Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and the incidence is rising. Currently, there are no effective treatments for patients with advanced forms of thyroid cancer. Anaplastic thyroid represents the most severe form of the disease with 95% mortality at 6 months. It is therefore critical to better understand the mechanisms involved in thyroid cancer development and progression in order to develop more effective therapeutic strategies. Cell lines derived from thyroid tumors represent a critical tool to understand the oncogenic mechanisms driving thyroid cancer, as well as preclinical tools to study the efficacy of new therapies in vitro and in vivo. For thyroid cancer, the development of new therapies has been hampered by the lack of thyroid cancer cell lines in the widely used NCI-60 panel which has been used to screen over 100,000 anti-cancer drugs. In addition, the recent discovery that ~20 out of 40 existing thyroid cancer cell lines are either redundant or misidentified with cell lines of other tissue lineages has further hampered progress in the field. Of the available cell lines, 23 were identified as unique and presumably of thyroid origin based on the expression of thyroid-specific genes. Thus, there is a great need for validated thyroid cancer cell lines representing different stages of disease in addition to distinct oncogenic mutations. New, authenticated thyroid cancer cell lines are beginning to be developed, adding to the tools available to study genes and pathways important for thyroid cancer pathogenesis. In summary, the use of validated thyroid cancer cell lines that closely recapitulate disease is critical for the discovery of new drug targets and ultimately new therapies.	9	2012

10.1242/jeb.051003	08B4CEC6	Knocking down expression of Hsp22 and Hsp23 by RNA interference affects recovery from chill coma in Drosophila melanogaster.	To protect cells from the damaging effects of environmental stresses, all organisms possess a universal stress response involving upregulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps). The mechanisms underlying chilling injuries and the subsequent recovery phase are only beginning to be understood in insects. Hsp22 and Hsp23 are both upregulated during the recovery from prolonged chill coma in Drosophila melanogaster. This prompted us to investigate the functional significance of these modulations by testing whether expression of these two small Hsps is necessary for recovery after cold stress. We used the GAL4/UAS system to separately knock down expression of Hsp22 and Hsp23, and assayed three aspects of recovery performance in transgenic adults that had undergone 12 h of chill coma at 0°C. The time to recover (short-term recovery) and mobility parameters (medium-term recovery) were significantly impaired in the transgenic flies in which Hsp22 or Hsp23 was suppressed. Our findings show that both Hsp22 and Hsp23 play important roles in the recovery from chill coma in adult males, and suggest that these contribute to adaptive responses to fluctuating thermal conditions.	17	2010

The knee joint kinematics of a group (n=20) of elderly normal subjects (mean age=67 years) were investigated using flexible electrogoniometry. The flexion-extension angle of the knee was recorded during a range of functional activities performed as part of a circuit in and around the hospital. The functions analysed including gait, walking on slopes, stair negotiation, the use of standard and low chairs and a bath. The data were used to produce the pattern of joint angulation against the percentage of the cycle for each individual conducting each activity. Further the maximum and minimum knee joint angles and the excursion of the joint during the cycle were identified. The results indicate gait and slopes require less than 90 degrees of knee flexion, stairs and chairs 90-120 degrees of flexion and a bath approximately 135 degrees of flexion. The data suggests that 110 degrees of flexion would seem a suitable goal for the rehabilitation of motion in the knee. It is concluded that flexible electrogoniometry is a suitable and practical method for evaluating knee motion during a range of functional activities. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.	53	2000
10.1103/PhysRevB.56.R12741	058F5AF4	Scaling and the Metal-Insulator Transition in Si/SiGe Quantum Wells	The existence of a metal-insulator transition at zero magnetic field in two- dimensional electron systems has recently been confirmed in high mobility Si-MOSFETs. In this work, the temperature dependence of the resistivity of gated Si/SiGe/Si quantum well structures has revealed a similar metal- insulator transition as a function of carrier density at zero magnetic field.   We also report evidence for a Coulomb gap in the temperature dependence of the resistivity of the dilute 2D hole gas confined in a SiGe quantum well.   In addition, the resistivity in the insulating phase scales with a single parameter, and is sample independent. These results are consistent with the occurrence of a metal-insulator transition at zero magnetic field in SiGe square quantum wells driven by strong hole-hole interactions.	4	1997

10.1186/1471-2180-8-112	076912B8	Molecular epidemiology and pathogenic potential of underdiagnosed human papillomavirus types.	BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) tests are crucial diagnostic tools for the prevention of neoplastic lesions of the uterine cervix. However most commercial methods are designed to detect high-risk (HR) HPV types and a limited selection of low-risk ones, thus missing a fair number of intermediate/low-risk types. As a result, many HPV infections remain undiagnosed, generating distrust in virological diagnosis among gynaecologists, who continue to rely preferentially on cytological and colposcopic findings. RESULTS: In this study, we tested 6,335 consecutive clinical samples, most of them from Italian patients with cytological abnormalities. The samples, collected in 2000-2007, were analyzed using PCR amplification of a 173-206 bp (depending on HPV type) conserved region in the L1 open reading frame, restriction endonuclease analysis and, where required, sequence analysis for type determination. Analysis of a smaller male sample and long term follow-up of a few female subjects was also performed. A total of 2,161 samples tested positive for HPV DNA (32.1%); 21.3% of them were mixed infections. Overall, 59 known and 2 unknown HPV types were detected. Their relative prevalence was calculated; notably, types not clearly identifiable using the most common commercial method accounted for 36% of infections. Clinical findings associated with the underdiagnosed types ranged from H-SIL to low-grade abnormalities, although none of these infections resulted in invasive cancer. CONCLUSION: Given the high prevalence of some underdiagnosed HPV types in the population (principally HPV53, HPV66, HPV84, and HPV87) and their frequent association with cytological abnormalities, techniques capable of detecting and typing them would prove extremely useful.	11	2008

10.1103/RevModPhys.80.1201	091E5426	Colloquium: Unusual resonators: Plasmonics, metamaterials, and random media	Superresolution, extraordinary transmission, total absorption, and localization of electromagnetic waves are currently attracting growing attention. These phenomena are related to different physical objects and are usually studied within the context of different, sometimes rather sophisticated, physical approaches. Remarkably, all these seemingly unrelated phenomena owe their origin to the same underlying physical mechanism - wave interaction with an open resonator. Here we show that it is possible to describe all of these effects in a unified way, mapping each system onto a simple resonator model. Such description provides a thorough understanding of the phenomena, explains all the main features of their complex behaviour, and enables to control the system via the resonator parameters: eigenfrequencies, Q-factors, and coupling coefficients.	225	2008
10.3748/wjg.v18.i24.3081	0C07ED54	Pseudomyxoma peritonei of 92 chinese patients: Clinical characteristics, pathological classification and prognostic factors	AIM: To assess the clinicopathologic features and its relationship with prognosis of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) in Chinese patients.\n\nMETHODS: The clinicopathologic features and follow-up data of 92 patients with PMP were reviewed and retrospectively analyzed. The cases were categorized into three groups: disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM), peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis (PMCA), and peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis with intermediate or discordant features (PMCA-I/D). The log-rank test was used to analyze survival for each group and various clinicopathological parameters. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazard models were constructed to determine the important factors associated with survival.\n\nRESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 51.9 years (range: 22-76 years). The median follow up was 124 mo. The 3-, 5- and 10-year survival rates were 74.0%, 67.4% and 49.1%, respectively. There were 49 (53.2%) patients with DPAM, 26 (28.3%) with PMCA-I and 17 (18.5%) with PMCA. Patients with DPAM, PMCA-I/D and PMCA exhibited statistically significant difference in survival (P = 0.001). The 3 year survival for DPAM, PMCAI/D and PMCA was 97.0%, 80.0% and 67.0%, respectively; the 5 year survival was 80.0%, 67.0% and 50.0%, respectively; and the 10 year survival was 65.0%, 28.0% and 14.0%, respectively. Survival rate was significantly lowest in patients < 40 age years of age (P = 0.011). Appendiceal tumor and extra-ovarian parenchymal organ involvement were significantly related to overall survival. Patients with appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma (MACA) showed the significantly poorer prognosis (P = 0.011). Multivariate analysis showed that pathological classification, age, appendiceal tumor were significant related to overall survival.\n\nCONCLUSION: The clinical process "PMP" should be pathologically classified into DPAM, PMCA and PMCA-I/D. Pathological classification, age, appendiceal MACA are survival independent predictors in Chinese patients with PMP.	3	2012
10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.242301	05EDB850	Measuring the collective flow with jets	In nucleus-nucleus collisions, high-p(T) partons interact with a dense medium, which possesses strong collective flow components. Here, we demonstrate that the resulting medium-induced gluon radiation does not depend solely on the energy density of the medium, but also on the collective flow. Both components can be disentangled by the measurement of particle production associated with high-p(T) trigger particles, jetlike correlations, and jets. In particular, we show that flow effects lead to a characteristic breaking of the rotational symmetry of the average jet energy and jet multiplicity distribution in the eta x phi plane. We argue that data on the medium-induced broadening of jetlike particle correlations in Au + Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider may provide evidence for a significant distortion of parton fragmentation due to the longitudinal collective flow.	5	2004
10.1016/j.physletb.2004.03.059	03CF5D5D	Comparison of the Gottfried and Adler sum rules within the large-N c expansion	The Adler sum rule for deep inelastic neutrino scattering measures the isospin of the nucleon and is hence exact. By contrast, the corresponding Gottfried sum rule for charged lepton scattering was based merely on a valence picture and is modified both by perturbative and by non-perturbative effects. Noting that the known perturbative corrections to two-loop order are suppressed by a factor 1/Nc 2, relative to those for higher moments, we propose that this suppression persists at higher orders and also applies to higher-twist effects. Moreover, we propose that the differences between the corresponding radiative corrections to higher non-singlet moments in charged-lepton and neutrino deep inelastic scattering are suppressed by 1/N c 2, in all orders of perturbation theory. For the first moment, in the Gottfried sum rule, the substantial discrepancy between the measured value and the valence-model expectation may be attributed to an intrinsic isospin asymmetry in the nucleon sea, as is indeed the case in a chiral-soliton model, where the discrepancy persists in the limit N c??????. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.
