The Gaia hypothesis: Conjectures and refutations	2003	The uncertainties surrounding global climate change provide ample evidence, if any were necessary, of the need for a whole-system view of the Earth. Arguably the most visible - and controversial - attempt to understand Earth as a system has been Lovelock's Gaia theory. Gaia has been a fruitful hypothesis generator, and has prompted many intriguing conjectures about how biological processes might contribute to planetary-scale regulation of atmospheric chemistry and climate. In many important cases, however, these conjectures are refuted by the available data. For example, Gaia theory predicts that the composition of the atmosphere should be tightly regulated by biological processes, but rates of carbon uptake into the biosphere have accelerated by only about 2% in response to the 35% rise in atmospheric CO2 since pre-industrial times. Gaia theory would predict that atmospheric CO2 should be more sensitively regulated by terrestrial ecosystem uptake (which is biologically mediated) than by ocean uptake (which is primarily abiotic), but both processes are about equally insensitive to atmospheric CO2 levels. Gaia theory predicts that biological feedbacks should make the Earth system less sensitive to perturbation, but the best available data suggest that the net effect of biologically mediated feedbacks will be to amplify, not reduce, the Earth system's sensitivity to anthropogenic climate change. Gaia theory predicts that biological by-products in the atmosphere should act as planetary climate regulators, but the Vostok ice core indicates that CO2, CH4, and dimethyl sulfide - all biological by-products - function to make the Earth warmer when it is warm, and colder when it is cold. Gaia theory predicts that biological feedbacks should regulate Earth's climate over the long term, but peaks in paleotemperature correspond to peaks in paleo-CO2 in records stretching back to the Permian; thus if CO2 is biologically regulated as part of a global thermostat, that thermostat has been hooked up backwards for at least the past 300 million years. Gaia theory predicts that organisms alter their environment to their own benefit, but throughout most of the surface ocean (comprising more than half of the globe), nutrient depletion by plankton has almost created a biological desert, and is kept in check only by the nutrient starvation of the plankton themselves. Lastly, where organisms enhance their environment for themselves, they create positive feedback; thus Gaia theory's two central principles - first, that organisms stabilize their environment, and second, that organisms alter their environment in ways that benefit them - are mutually inconsistent with one another. These examples suggest that the further development of Gaia theory will require more deliberate comparison of theory and data.

The Gaia hypothesis: A fruitful fallacy?	1990	In. 1968, Lovelock proposed that the Earth's bioshpere, atmosphere, oceans, and soils form a single living organism, which he called Gaia after the Greek Earth goddess. This entity constitutes a feedback system which supposedly seeks an optimal physical and chemical environment for life on Earth. Most scientists accept a weaker version of the hypothesis, that life has had a tremendous impact on the physical environment. They reject the strong version on the basis that planetary self- regulation would need foresight and planning by living organisms, which is incompatible with natural selection. Lovelock subsequently proposed a simple computer model, called Daisyworld, which shows that, under certain conditions, feedback systems without foresight can stablize external inputs. The main value of the Gaia hypothesis lies in its holistic perspective, which is needed to avoid environmentally undesirable, cumulative effects of small decisions	Experientia	{u'scopus': u'2-s2.0-0025304614', u'doi': u'10.1007/BF01951752', u'issn': u'0014-4754'}	http://www.mendeley.com/research/gaia-hypothesis-fruitful-fallacy
Toward a future for gaia theory: An editorial comment	2002	The three papers in this issue of Climatic Change (Kirchner, 2002; Kleidon, 2002; Lenton, 2002) are probably the most concentrated effort in recent years by several prominent theoreticians of the biosphere to set forth their views on the current status and future of Gaia theory.

Do evolution and ecology need the Gaia hypothesis?	2007	Gaia theory, which describes the life-environment system of the Earth as stable and self-regulating, has remained at the fringes of mainstream biological science owing to its historically inadequate definition and apparent incompatibility with individual-level natural selection. The key issue is whether and why the biosphere might tend towards stability and self-regulation. We review the various ways in which these issues have been addressed by evolutionary and ecological theory, and relate these to 'Gaia theory'. We then ask how this theory extends the perspectives offered by these disciplines, and how it might be tested by novel modelling approaches and laboratory experiments using emergent technologies. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Darwinian evolution does not rule out the Gaia hypothesis	2002	This study explores so-called Darwinian Daisyworlds mathematically rigorously in detail. The original Daisyworld was introduced by Watson & Lovelock (1983) to demonstrate how two species of daisies regulate the global temperature of their planet through competition among these species against the rising solar luminosity, i.e. the Gaia hypothesis. Its variants are Darwinian Daisyworlds in which daisies can adapt themselves to the local temperature. Robertson & Robinson (1998) insist their Darwinian daisies lose the ability for temperature regulation on the basis of their spreadsheet simulations. Lenton & Lovelock (2000) point out that the constraints on adaptation recovers Darwinian daisies' ability of temperature regulation on the basis of their Euler-code simulations. The present study shows there exist the exact and closed-form solutions to these two Daisyworlds. The results contradict the former studies: Robertson and Robinson's daisies do regulate the global temperature even longer than non-adaptive daisies; Lenton and Lovelock's daisies are less adaptive than Robertson and Robinson's daisies because of the constraints on adaptation; the introduction of weak adaptability drives species into a dead end of evolution. Thus, the present results confirm that the Gaia hypothesis and Darwinian evolution can coexist. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Gaia hypothesis: Fact, theory, and wishful thinking	2002	Organisms can greatly affect their environments, and the feedback coupling between organisms and their environments can shape the evolution of both. Beyond these generally accepted facts, the Gaia hypothesis advances three central propositions: (1) that biologically mediated feedbacks contribute to environmental homeostasis, (2) that they make the environment more suitable for life, and (3) that such feedbacks should arise by Darwinian natural selection. These three propositions do not fare well under close scrutiny. (1) Biologically mediated feedbacks are not intrinsically homeostatic. Many of the biological mechanisms that affect global climate are destabilizing, and it is likely that the net effect of biological feedbacks will be to amplify, not dampen, global warming. (2) Nor do biologically mediated feedbacks necessarily enhance the environment, although it will often appear as if this were the case, simply because natural selection will favor organisms that do well in their environments which means doing wellunder the conditions that they and their co-occurring species have created. (3) Finally, Gaian feedbacks can evolve by natural selection, but so can anti-Gaian feedbacks. Daisyworld models evolve Gaian feedback because they assume that any trait that improves the environment will also give a reproductive advantage to its carriers (over other organisms that share the same environment). In the real world, by contrast, natural selection favors any trait that gives its carriers a reproductive advantage over its non-carriers, whether it improves or degrades the environment (and thereby benefits or hinders its carriers and non-carriers alike). Thus Gaian and anti-Gaian feedbacks are both likely to evolve.

Exploring Gaia theory: Artificial life on a planetary scale	2000	Gaia theory, the view that the biota can both affect their environment and do so in a manner that benefits life in general, is an extremely controversial interpretation of the complex relationships between the biota and biosphere. Since individual Gaian phenomena can span spatial scales fi om cellular to planetary, they evade thorough analysis and empirical validation. Consequently, a good deal of Gaian thinking revolves around an abstract computer model, Daisyworld [24]. However, this model fails to properly account for natural selection's role in Gaian emergence, Although we propose an alternate scheme that offers some improvement - one based on evolutionary computation and individual-based simulation - the field remains wide open for investigations from the alife perspective. This paper reviews both models along with a few natural Gaian phenomena before generalizing a set of common primitive features and emergent properties from the real, and artificial examples. These shared characteristics will hopefully provide a backbone for a much-desired "Gaia-logic" and assist other alife researchers in the search far additional Gaian models.

A reappraisal of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle: What can we learn by extracting concepts from Gaia theory?	2008	Although soil scientists and most environmental scientists are acutely aware of the interactions between the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, for conceptual convenience when portraying the nitrogen cycle in text books the N cycle tends to be considered in isolation from its interactions with the cycling of other elements and water, usually as a snap shot at the current time; the origins of dinitrogen are rarely considered, for example. The authors suggest that Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis provides a useful and stimulating framework for consideration of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle. If it is used, it suggests that urbanization and management of sewage, and intensive animal rearing are probably bigger global issues than nitrogen deposition from fossil fuel combustion, and that plant evolution may be driven by the requirement of locally sustainable and near optimal soil mineral N supply dynamics. This may, in turn, be partially regulating global carbon and oxygen cycles. It is suggested that pollutant N deposition may disrupt this essential natural plant and terrestrial ecosystem evolutionary process, causing biodiversity change. Interactions between the Earth and other bodies in the solar system, and possibly beyond, also need to be considered in the context of the global N cycle over geological time scales. This is because of direct potential impacts on the nitrogen content of the atmosphere, potential long-term impacts of past boloid collisions on plate tectonics and thus on global N cycling via subduction and volcanic emissions, and indirect effects upon C, O and water cycling that all may impact upon the N cycle in the long term. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Special theme: The Gaia hypothesis	2002	The Gaia hypothesis, a controversial theory about the degree to which life on Earth controls the planetary environment (e.g., Lovelock, 2000), has long been critiqued because of the difficulty of testing various sub-hypotheses. In part, this difficulty arose owing to a lack of clarity about critical definitions – e.g., what precisely was meant by ‘life’, ‘environmental control’, ‘benefit for life’, ‘self-regulation’, etc. (e.g., see my recent book review, Schneider, 2001, for an entry point to this debate). In this issue of Climatic Change, the first paper by Axel Kleidon aims to advance debate over the Gaia hypothesis by providing precise definitions of terms in order to faciliate empirical tests. However, like almost anything written about the Gaia hypothesis, controversy still abounds. Therefore, I am grateful that three insightful scientists with keen interests in this topic – JamesW. Kirchner, Timothy M. Lenton, and Tyler Volk – have agreed to write short papers using the Kleidon article as a springboard to present their varying views on the Gaia hypothesis. I hope that this diverse collection of opinions and analyses on Gaia will be of interest to the interdisciplinary climatological community and will contribute to the ongoing debate on the interactions of life with the rest of the environment.

New statements on the Gaia theory.	1995	Gaia is the name the ancient Greeks gave to their goddess of the Earth and is the root of words like geography and geology. Gaia is also a straightforward scientific theory about the Earth and the organisms that inhabit it. Gaia theory is testable and has a proper mathematical basis in a set of closely coupled differential equations. We do not yet know if it is a good explanation of the way our planet works; the evidence is only partially gathered. Its main value at this stage is to provide a different way to look at the Earth. In science, Gaia theory has already led to significant discoveries but just as important it forces us to question whether the good of humankind is the only thing that matters. The true value of the journeys into space was to reveal the Earth as a live planet. They made us realise for the first time that humanism is not enough. The view from space teaches that we are part of a greater entity, the Earth, and that our survival and its good health are inextricably entwined. Perhaps in time we can expand our view to encompass the larger systems of the galaxy and the Universe. Now the Earth needs our full attention.

The Gaia hypothesis: Can it be tested?	1989	The Gaia hypothesis' central theme is that biological processes homeostatically maintain, on a planetary scale, geochemical and climatic conditions favorable for life. A number of distinct hypotheses have been proposed, spanning a range from the self-evident to the highly speculative. The self-evident forms of Gaia reiterate the well-documented fact that biological processes are critical to biogeochemical cycles, adding the straightforward (though important) point that the coupling between biotic and physical processes should create feedback loops. The speculative forms of Gaia assert that biological processes regulate the physical environment, keeping Earth's climate and surface geochemistry stable and favorable for life. As metaphors, these versions of Gaia are intriguing, untestable, and, if taken literally as a basis for research, potentially misleading. As hypotheses, they are ill-defined, unparsimonious, and unfalsifiable.

Anthropocentrism and the Argument from Gaia Theory	2010	Anthropocentrism holds that the only things valuable in themselves are: human beings, their desires and needs, and the satisfaction of those. In turn, Gaia theory holds that the Earth and all creatures on it constitute something akin to a vast living being. Many layfolk maintain that Gaia theory implies the falsity of anthropocentrism, and thus puts the kibosh on that doctrine. But philosophical writers deny this implication. This paper therefore argues for what we may call “the Kibosh Thesis”—that Gaia theory, when correctly understood, does indeed put the kibosh on anthropocentrism. It defends this thesis by appealing to “the Part-Whole Thesis”—that no parts of a living being which do not constitute the whole being can have as much intrinsic value as the being itself has. Since the evidence supporting Gaia theory is mounting, this thesis appears to provide a fairly strong argument against anthropocentrism. In arguing for this position, I show why anthropocentrism is a plausible doctrine, specify Gaia theory’s main claims, meet the main philosophical objections to the Kibosh Thesis, and develop the argument from the Part-Whole Thesis.

Atmospheric homeostasis by and for the biosphere: the gaia hypothesis	1974	During the time, 3.2 × 109 years, that life has been present on Earth, the physical and chemical conditions of most of the planetary surface have never varied from those most favourable for life. The geological record reads that liquid water was always present and that the pH was never far from neutral. During this same period, however, the Earth's radiation environment underwent large changes. As the sun moved along the course set by the main sequence of stars its output will have increased at least 30% and possibly 100%. It may also have fluctuated in brightness over periods of a few million years. At the same time hydrogen was escaping to space from the Earth and so causing progressive changes in the chemical environment. This in turn through atmospheric compositional changes could have affected the Earth's radiation balance. It may have been that these physical and chemical changes always by blind chance followed the path whose bounds are the conditions favouring the continued existence of life. This paper offers an alternative explanation that, early after life began it acquired control of the planetary environment and that this homeostasis by and for the biosphere has persisted ever since. Historic and contemporary evidence and arguments for this hypothesis will be presented.

The gaia hypothesis: Science on a pagan planet - by michael ruse	2014	In 1965 English scientist James Lovelock had a flash of insight: the Earth is not just teeming with life; the Earth, in some sense, is life. He mulled this revolutionary idea over for several years, first with his close friend the novelist William Golding, and then in an extensive collaboration with the American scientist Lynn Margulis. In the early 1970s, he finally went public with the Gaia hypothesis, the idea that everything happens for an end: the good of planet Earth. Lovelock and Margulis were scorned by professional scientists, but the general public enthusiastically embraced Lovelock and his hypothesis. People joined Gaia groups; churches had Gaia services, sometimes with new music written especially for the occasion. There was a Gaia atlas, Gaia gardening, Gaia herbs, Gaia retreats, Gaia networking, and much more. And the range of enthusiasts was—and still is—broad.           In The Gaia Hypothesis, philosopher Michael Ruse, with his characteristic clarity and wit, uses Gaia and its history, its supporters and detractors, to illuminate the nature of science itself. Gaia emerged in the 1960s, a decade when authority was questioned and status and dignity stood for nothing, but its story is much older. Ruse traces Gaia’s connection to Plato and a long history of goal-directed and holistic—or organicist—thinking and explains why Lovelock and Margulis’s peers rejected it as pseudoscience. But Ruse also shows why the project was a success. He argues that Lovelock and Margulis should be commended for giving philosophy firm scientific basis and for provoking important scientific discussion about the world as a whole, its homeostasis or—in this age of global environmental uncertainty—its lack thereof.           Melding the world of science and technology with the world of feeling, mysticism, and religion, The Gaia Hypothesis will appeal to a broad range of readers, from students and scholars of the history and philosophy of science to anyone interested in New Age culture.

Gaia theory in Brazilian High School biology textbooks	2009	Gaia theory proposes that a cybernetic system including the biota and the physicochemical environment regulates environmental variables at a global scale, keeping them within a range that makes Earth inhabitable by living beings. One can argue that this theory can play an important role in school science, since it bears upon current environmental problems, contributes to cross-disciplinary learning, and may help students understand the nature of science. Nevertheless, discourses about Gaia include both scientific and non-scientific ideas, and, consequently, this theory has been seen as pseudoscience, or even antiscience, as an unwarranted view, entangled with mysticism. But an informed view about the contributions and risks associated with Gaia as part of science education depends on a general analysis about the treatment of this theory in school knowledge. Here, we offer the first analysis of this sort, critically evaluating how Gaia is addressed in a representative sample of Brazilian textbooks (n = 18). We present data about the presence or not of Gaia theory among the contents covered by the textbooks, the presence of the claim that Earth is living, whether and how they use analogies to justify this claim, the discussion of evidence for and against Gaia, and the treatment of its relevance to current issues. Gaia theory is explicitly addressed in ca. 39% of the analyzed textbooks. There is a general script that the textbooks that explicitly name the theory follow when discussing Gaia. First, they argue that life affects the environment, and support this argument by means of examples, then, explain what the Gaia theory proposes, discuss evidence in favor either of the idea that Earth is living or Gaia theory in general, introduce one or more analogies to justify the claim of a living Earth, and, finally, offer remarks on the current importance of Gaia. Three analogies used by Lovelock himself were found in the analyzed textbooks, Gaia as a superorganism, the analogy between Gaia and a redwood tree, and between Gaia and the Greek goddess of Earth. The most frequent was the superorganism analogy. The idea of a control system including the biota and the physicochemical environment and any discussion about theoretical and empirical advances resulting from Gaia theory were absent from most analyzed textbooks, which focused mainly on the claim of a living Earth. Although Gaia can contribute to the understanding of environmental issues, the treatment found in most of the analyzed schoolbooks puts so much emphasis on the idea that Earth is living and is so close to an animistic understanding of the Earth system that it is likely that it will bring no true contribution to the development of adequate conceptions about that system and the connections between human activities and the environmental crisis.

Tidal flats in a daisy world; Geological Society of America, 2002 annual meeting	2002	Three classic localities have received intensive study over the past 40 years, the humid climate on-lap and off-lap tidal flats of western Andros, the semi-arid flats on the Caicos platform in the Caribbean, and the arid off-lap areas of the southern Arabian Gulf. The styles of sedimentation differ in many ways due to climate, salinity, and sediment supply but all conform to Gaia principles of self-regulation. Humid on-lap or transgressive flats of NW Andros Island are eroding, are laced with meandering tidal channels lined with coarser material, and sub- and intertidal sediments with characteristic sedimentary structures are on-lapping supratidal marshes. The off-lap regressive areas of SW Andros are not eroding, have few tidal channels, and inter- and supratidal sediments overlie subtidal sediments. In the short term, sediment supply and wave exposure, rather than changes in sea level, regulate transgressive versus regressive sedimentation at Andros Island. Dolomite forms on supratidal zones at both the Andros and Caicos localities, and the zones of dolomitization are controlled by self-regulating sedimentary processes. Marine cementation is absent. The extensive arid off-lap tidal flats of the Arabian Gulf for the most part lack meandering tidal channels, and shell debris forms extensive protective barrier islands. Both syndepositionally cemented and mobile ooid sands form in channels and terminate as tidal deltas seaward and landward of the barrier-island trend. Marine cemented grainstones form extensive hardgrounds that underlie prograding sedimentary facies and limit the depth to which tidal channels can erode. Dolomite, anhydrite, and gypsum form on supratidal sabkhas, the sedimentary equivalent of marshes at Andros Island. Abundant sediment supply has allowed these tidal flats to accrete rapidly facilitated by wave-breaking coral reefs and rapidly growing chenier-like barrier islands and spits. Sedimentary, microbial, and diagenetic processes on all tidal flats are interrelated and interdependent in what can be considered a micro-daisy world.

The simulated evolution of biochemical guilds: reconciling Gaia theory and natural selection.	1999	Gaia theory, which states that organisms both affect and regulate their environment, poses an interesting problem to Neo-Darwinian evolutionary biologists and provides an exciting set of phenomena for artificial-life investigation. The key challenge is to explain the emergence of biotic communities that are capable, via their implicit coordination, of regulating large-scale biogeochemical factors such as the temperature and chemical composition of the biosphere, but to assume no evolutionary mechanisms beyond contemporary natural selection. Along with providing an introduction to Gaia theory, this article presents simulations of Gaian emergence based on an artificial-life model involving genetic algorithms and guilds of simple metabolizing agents. In these simulations, resource competition leads to guild diversity; the ensemble of guilds then manifests life-sustaining nutrient recycling and exerts distributed control over environmental nutrient ratios. These results illustrate that standard individual-based natural selection is sufficient to explain Gaian self-organization, and they help clarify the relationships between two key metrics of Gaian activity: recycling and regulation.

Darwinian selection leads to Gaia.	2002	The Gaia hypothesis, in its strongest form, states that the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and biota form a tightly coupled system that maintains environmental conditions close to optimal for life. According to Gaia theory, optimal conditions are intrinsic, immutable properties of living organisms. It is assumed that the role of Darwinian selection is to favor organisms that act to stabilize environmental conditions at these optimal levels. In this paper, an alternative form of Gaia theory based on more traditional Darwinian principles is proposed. In the new approach, environmental regulation is a consequence of population dynamics, not Darwinian selection. The role of selection is to favor organisms that are best adapted to prevailing environmental conditions. However, the environment is not a static backdrop for evolution, but is heavily influenced by the presence of living organisms. The resulting co-evolving dynamical process eventually leads to the convergence of equilibrium and optimal conditions. A simple Daisyworld model is used to illustrate this convergence phenomenon. Sensitivity analysis of the Daisyworld model suggests that in stable ecosystems, the convergence of equilibrium and optimal conditions is inevitable, provided there are no externally driven shocks to the system. The end result may appear to be the product of a cooperative venture, but is in fact the outcome of Darwinian selection acting upon "selfish" organisms.

Developing the Gaia theory: A response to the criticisms of Kirchner and Volk	2003	To evaluate the genetic diversity of the Xinjiang Tarim red deer (Cervus elaphus yarkandensis) population, we analyzed the frequencies of microsatellite alleles. Samples were collected from 3 isolated populations in Xaya, Lopnur and Qarqan of Xinjiang. Although 10 microsatellite loci were examined, alleles of 133 to 190 base-pairs were detected for only 3 loci: BM5004, BM4208 and BM888. The average observed multilocus heterozygosity was 0.08 0.04 for the Xaya, 0 for the Lopnur, and 0.17 0.08 for the Qarqan population. The average heterozygosity of all populations was 0.08 0.02. The observed heterozygosities were significantly lower than the expected values. The present results suggest that the bottleneck effect has occurred in the populations of the Xinjiang Tarim red deer.

Catastrophes on Daisyworld	2003	For 20 years, a research tradition based on 'Daisyworld' models, which have strong coupling between life and the abiotic environment, has developed largely independently of mainstream theoretical ecology. A new paper in this tradition shows how small changes in external forcing can lead to catastrophic environmental change on this virtual planet. This has potential implications for the way that we view the Earth system, both in respect to the effects of human actions and for testing Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis.

Daisyworld: A review	2008	Daisyworld is a simple planetary model designed to show the long-term effects of coupling between life and its environment. Its original form was introduced by James Lovelock as a defense against criticism that his Gaia theory of the Earth as a self-regulating homeostatic system requires teleological control rather than being an emergent property. The central premise, that living organisms can have major effects on the climate system, is no longer controversial. The Daisyworld model has attracted considerable interest from the scientific community and has now established itself as a model independent of, but still related to, the Gaia theory. Used widely as both a teaching tool and as a basis for more complex studies of feedback systems, it has also become an important paradigm for the understanding of the role of biotic components when modeling the Earth system. This paper collects the accumulated knowledge from the study of Daisyworld and provides the reader with a concise account of its important properties. We emphasize the increasing amount of exact analytic work on Daisyworld and are able to bring together and summarize these results from different systems for the first time. We conclude by suggesting what a more general model of life-environment interaction should be based on.

Applying Cellular Automata and DEVS Methodologies to Digital Games: A Survey	2010	Cellular automata were designed by John von Neumann in the 1940s, as a mathematical abstraction for modeling self-replicating algorithms. Since then, cellular automata have been widely studied theoretically and evolved into multiple variants. In the 1970s, Bernard P. Zeigler proposed a formalism rooted on systems theory principles, named DEVS (discrete-event systems specifications), which paved the way for component-based modeling and simulation and related methodologies. The purpose of this article is to survey how cellular automata and its variant, called cell-DEVS, may be used to implement computer simulations that can be used as digital serious games. The authors illustrate that implementation through some of the practical applications of such cellular automata. They show various serious game applications using real case studies: first, a simple bouncing ball and pinball game, a particle collision model, another on gossip propagation, and an application on human behavior at a metro station.Then, they show an application to social simulation using a voters game, a theoretical application (a model called Daisy World, which is derived from Gaia theory), and applications to physical phenomena such as a sandpile formation model or, finally, a three-dimensional model of a “virtual clay” that changes its shape when it is subject to pressure effects.

A fitness based analysis of Daisyworld	2007	The Gaia hypothesis [Lovelock, J., Margulis, L., 1974. Atmospheric homeostasis: the Gaia hypothesis. Tellus 26, 1], that the earth functions as a self-regulating system, has never sat particularly comfortably with ideas in mainstream biology [Anon, 2002. In pursuit of arrogant simplicities. Nature 416, 247]. A lack of any clear role for evolution in the model has led to claims of teleology-that self-regulation emerges because it is pre-ordained to do so [Doolittle, W.F., 1981. Is nature really motherly? CoEvol. Q. 58-63; Dawkins, R., 1979. The Extended Phenotype. Oxford University Press, Oxford]. The Daisyworld parable [Watson, A.J., Lovelock, J.E., 1983. Biological homeostasis of the global environment-the parable of Daisyworld. Tellus B 35, 284], a simple mathematical illustration of Gaia, went some way to addressing these critiques but, despite recent success in incorporating natural selection [Stocker, S.,1995. Regarding mutations in Daisyworld models. J. Theor. Biol. 175, 495; Lenton, T.M., 1998. Gaia and natural selection. Nature 394, 439; Lenton, T.M., Lovelock, J.E., 2001. Daisyworld revisited: quantifying biological effects on planetary self-regulation. Tellus B 53, 288; Wood, A.J., Ackland, G.J., Lenton, T.M., 2006. Mutation of albedo and growth response leads to oscillations in a spatial Daisyworld. J. Theor. Biol. 242, 188], it remains a widely held view that the ideas are inconsistent with biological principles. We show that standard methodology from quantitative genetics can be used to predict the stationary states and dynamic behaviour of Daisyworlds. The system regulates its temperature due to the low-level evolutionary dynamics of competition between the thermally coupled daisies, no higher level principle is invoked. A reconciliation of Gaia with evolutionary theory may allow further development of evolutionary arguments for the existence of global self-regulatory systems. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Real concerns, false gods	2006	James Lovelock, the renowned scientist who pioneered the measurement of atmospheric trace gases, here offers his take on the future of energy. In brief, a vigorous turn towards nuclear power will be necessary to prevent the catastrophic climatic changes caused by an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuel.  Several decades ago, Lovelock developed an idea called the Gaia hypothesis, named after the ancient Greek goddess of the Earth. He postulated that "life on Earth actively keeps the surface conditions always favourable for whatever is the contemporary ensemble of organisms". Evolutionary biologists such as Ford Doolittle and Richard Dawkins countered, by showing that neither life as a whole nor specific living things could be selected by evolution to create favourable global surface conditions, and Lovelock has conceded this point. He soon developed what he now calls Gaia theory.  What is Gaia and what is the theory? Gaia is the system consisting of all life and the environments that life affects — soils, atmosphere, oceans and surface rocks. The theory states that Gaia is a closely coupled, evolving system that has the goal of keeping the climate favourable for life as it currently stands. This idea of a goal parts company with how virtually all Earth and environmental scientists see the world, and is important here because Lovelock's new book blends Gaia theory and metaphor with a viewpoint on energy and the greenhouse effect.  The concerns are truly massive. Our planet is in crisis. Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide is affecting the biosphere's radiative balance, ecosystems and ocean acidity. According to Lovelock, we have inadvertently declared war on Gaia, and she "now threatens us with the ultimate punishment of extinction". I submit that such anthropomorphic language does more harm than good to the author's arguments. But more on that later.  In The Revenge of Gaia, Lovelock evaluates the candidates for energy sources that do not emit carbon dioxide. Spreading inherently huge networks of solar, wind or biomass farms only further desecrates the vital and increasingly scarred landscape of the biosphere and should be limited to small doses. Carbon sequestration deserves trials but the scales required are stupefying. The only recourse is the large-scale deployment of nuclear fission, at least as a stopgap until nuclear fusion and an adequate portfolio of renewables comes along.James Lovelock, the renowned scientist who pioneered the measurement of atmospheric trace gases, here offers his take on the future of energy.

The consequence of maximum thermodynamic efficiency in Daisyworld.	2002	The imaginary planet of Daisyworld is the simplest model used to illustrate the implications of the Gaia hypothesis. The dynamics of daisies and their radiative interaction with the environment are described by fundamental equations of population ecology theory and physics. The parameterization of the turbulent energy flux between areas of different biological cover is similar to the diffusive-type approximation used in simple climate models. Here I show that the small variation of the planetary diffusivity adopted in the classical version of Daisyworld limits the range of values for the solar insolation for which biota may grow in the planet. Recent studies suggest that heat transport in a turbulent medium is constrained to maximize its efficiency. This condition is almost equivalent to maximizing the rate of entropy production due to non-radiative sources. Here, I apply the maximum entropy principle (MEP) to Daisyworld. I conclude that the MEP sets the maximum range of values for the solar insolation with a non-zero amount of daisies. Outside this range, daisies cannot grow in the planet for any physically realistic climate distribution. Inside this range, I assume a distribution of daisies in agreement with the MEP. The results substantially enlarge the range of climate stability, due to the biota, in comparison to the classical version of Daisyworld. A very stable temperature is found when two different species grow in the planet.

On the homeostasis and bistability on a Gaian planet	2009	Geochemical disequilibrium of Earth's atmosphere is a sign of life. The fact that Earth's atmosphere is just right for life led Lovelock to propose the Gaia hypothesis: life itself regulates the environment on planetary scale in order to maintain habitability. This hypothesis is supported by the so-called Daisyworld parable, which illustrates a possible mechanism for such a self regulation. Here we revisit Daisyworld and challenge some of its conclusions from a closer examination of the model. We find that even within this simple, conceptual model of a Gaian planet there are regimes where climate is less homeostatic than on a dead planet. Furthermore, in other regimes, bistability between two climate states is found to exist due to the presence of life. This indicates that even if the Gaian stability might describe life in some planetary conditions, it need not be generic to all inhabited planets. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Forms of Gaian Ethics	1987	James lovelock's "gaia hypothesis"--the suggestion that life on earth functions in essential ways as one organism, as a single living entity--is extraordinarily suggestive for environmental philosophy. "what" exactly it suggests, however, is not yet so clear. although many of lovelock's own ethical conclusions are rather distressing for environmental ethics, there are other possible approaches to the gaia hypothesis. ethical philosophers might take gaia to be analogous to a "person" and thus to have the same sorts of values that more familiar sorts of persons have. deep ecologists might find in the gaia hypothesis a means by which to transform and reunderstand our concrete experience of the world. this essay canvasses some of the strengths, weaknesses, and possibilities of each approach.

'Rain-making' bacteria found around the world	2008	Some microbes are frequent flyers in clouds.  The same bacteria that cause frost damage on plants can help clouds to produce rain and snow. Studies on freshly fallen snow suggest that ‘bio-precipitation’ might be much more common than was suspected.  Before a cloud can produce rain or snow, rain drops or ice particles must form. This requires the presence of aerosols: tiny particles that serve as the nuclei for condensation. Most such particles are of mineral origin, but airborne microbes — bacteria, fungi or tiny algae — can do the job just as well. Unlike mineral aerosols, living organisms can catalyse ice formation even at temperatures close to 0 ºC.  The effect of the biological ‘ice nucleators’ on precipitation has been a mystery, not least because no one has yet been able to detect them in clouds.  Cloud counters  Now a team, led by Brent Christner, a microbiologist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, has managed to catalogue these rain-making microbes by looking at fresh snow collected at various mid- and high-latitude locations in North America, Europe and Antarctica.  They filtered the snow samples to remove particles, put those particles into containers of pure water, and slowly lowered the temperature, watching closely to see when the water froze. The higher the freezing temperature of any given sample, the greater the number of nuclei and the more likely they are to be biological in nature. To tease apart these two effects, the team treated the water samples with heat or chemicals to kill any bacteria inside, and again checked the freezing temperatures of the samples.  In this way they found between 4 and 120 ice nucleators per litre of melted snow. Some 69–100% of these particles were probably biological. The results are published in Science today1.  The researchers were surprised to find ‘rain-making’ bacteria in all samples; the snow from Antarctica had fewer than that from France and Montana, but it still had some. The results add evidence to the idea that microbes can safely travel long distances in clouds, and suggest that substantial biology-driven precipitation occurs everywhere on Earth.  "It is a wake-up call reminding us that some of the most active catalysts in clouds are being widely ignored, says Christner. "Biological particles do seem to play a very important part in generating snowfall and rain, especially at relatively warm cloud temperatures.”  Microbe water cycle  Most rain-making bacteria make their living as pathogens, using their ability to promote freezing at relatively warm temperatures to break the cell walls of the plants that they feed on. Some scientists note that this freezing ability also means that the bacteria get out of clouds and back to Earth more quickly, which is to the microbes' advantage.  “It is quite plausible that the organisms might be using their ice-nucleating ability to get out of the atmosphere,” says Tim Lenton, an Earth-system scientist at the University of East Anglia, UK.  This idea — that bacteria are at an advantage if they can travel distances in clouds and then return to Earth — which Lenton developed ten years ago with the late Bill Hamilton2, features in the Gaia hypothesis. The Gaia theory holds that that living and non-living parts of the Earth are a complex interacting system, in which living things have a regulatory effect that promotes life overall.  But humans also have a big effect on these regulatory processes. Changes in land-use, forestry and agriculture, such as expanding monoculture, changes the composition of microbes in the atmosphere. As biological components seem to have a large role in how rain forms, such changes may affect rainfall and climate in many places on Earth.  “It is about time for atmospheric and climate scientists to start thinking about the implications,” says Christner.

Its original form was introduced by James Lovelock as a defense against criticism that his Gaia theory of the Earth as a self-regulating homeostatic system requires teleological control rather than being an emergent property. The central premise, that living organisms can have major effects on the climate system, is no longer controversial. The Daisyworld model has attracted considerable interest from the scientific community and has now established itself as a model independent of, but still related to, the Gaia theory. Used widely as both a teaching tool and as a basis for more complex studies of feedback systems, it has also become an important paradigm for the understanding of the role of biotic components when modeling the Earth system. This paper collects the accumulated knowledge from the study of Daisyworld and provides the reader with a concise account of its important properties. We emphasize the increasing amount of exact analytic work on Daisyworld and are able to bring together and summarize these results from different systems for the first time. We conclude by suggesting what a more general model of life-environment interaction should be based on. Received 27 October 2006; accepted 2 July 2007; published 5 January 2008.

The ontogeny of Gaia: the role of microorganisms in planetary information network.	1995	The Gaia theory states that the whole surface layer of the globe, including organisms, atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere, can be viewed as a self-evolving homeostatic system. Bacteria play a principal role in this formative process. This line of thinking should answer several questions: Is the biosphere simply a set of essentially selfish individuals, each testing its fitness? Is memory in the biosphere confined to genes? Is the composition of ecosystems and their behavior only kind of dynamic equilibrium? Or is there a huge amount of epigenetic information that enables organisms to interpret properly their situation and behave accordingly? It is suggested here that it is the information flow, rather than pure thermodynamics and natural selection, that enables living beings not only to "read" their environment, interpret their situation and behave accordingly to this understanding, but also to establish geophysiology, to become part of Gaia. This flow comprises genes as well as signals, diffusible as well as permanent. From an analogy with the situation in the multicellular organism, three types of information mediators inside the body of Gaia are suggested: ultrastructure, diffusible signals and gene flux. With a shared gene pool, intricate ultrastructure and quickly diffusible signals, it is legitimate to consider Gaia a superorganism with an ontogeny.

Gaia as a complex adaptive system.	2002	We define the Gaia system of life and its environment on Earth, review the status of the Gaia theory, introduce potentially relevant concepts from complexity theory, then try to apply them to Gaia. We consider whether Gaia is a complex adaptive system (CAS) in terms of its behaviour and suggest that the system is self-organizing but does not reside in a critical state. Gaia has supported abundant life for most of the last 3.8 Gyr. Large perturbations have occasionally suppressed life but the system has always recovered without losing the capacity for large-scale free energy capture and recycling of essential elements. To illustrate how complexity theory can help us understand the emergence of planetary-scale order, we present a simple cellular automata (CA) model of the imaginary planet Daisyworld. This exhibits emergent self-regulation as a consequence of feedback coupling between life and its environment. Local spatial interaction, which was absent from the original model, can destabilize the system by generating bifurcation regimes. Variation and natural selection tend to remove this instability. With mutation in the model system, it exhibits self-organizing adaptive behaviour in its response to forcing. We close by suggesting how artificial life ('Alife') techniques may enable more comprehensive feasibility tests of Gaia.	Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Stability and instability in evolution.	1998	In this paper we propose a mechanism which tries to explain the presence of periods of stability and instability which occur during the evolution of living forms. According to the Gaia hypothesis there are feedback mechanisms which stabilise the biosphere. Adding the presence of parameters which are out of control of the biosphere and of different time-scales, we propose a model which might explain the periods of instability.

Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?	2002	At the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries, a few Russian scientists proposed an inter- related hypothesis on the coevolution of life and the environment. Because political, linguistic, and cultural barriers between Russia and the rest of the world existed through most of the twentieth century, many of their concepts are not well known in Western science. The synthesis of their works presented in this article leads to the concept of di- rected evolution of the global ecosystem. Similar to the influential Gaia hypothesis, this concept predicts evolution of the global ecosystem toward conditions generally favorable for organisms. Unlike the Gaia hypothesis, however, the directed evolution in works of Russian scientists results from the superposition of “micro-forces” controlled on local and regional scales by the universal criterion of biogeochemical selection.

Natural selection, Gaia, and inadvertent by-products: A reply to Lenton and Wilkinson's response	2003	Lenton and Wilkinson (2003), in response to me (Volk, 2002), have offered a number of important ideas for a Gaia theory of `regulatory feedbacks'between life and the global environment. After what are generally positive comments on a selection of their concepts, I focus my reply on one specific point of disagreement. Contrary to the claim of Lenton and Wilkinson, nitrogen fixation is merely another example of how a by-product affects the shared environment among organisms. For Gaia theory to properly incorporate evolution by natural selection, we must distinguish between life's products and by-products. Because organisms evolve in environments altered by these by-products, I continue to support the idea that feedback loops in the biosphere contain segments based solely upon by-products of organisms' metabolisms.

Is Gaia Really Conventional Ecology?	2014	The Gaia theory of Lovelock has had a very unequal treatment by conventional ecologists, ranging from being ignored to qualified support, I suggest that the phenomena described by Gaia are really capable of explanation by conventional ecological ideas using a gene/individual unit of selection. This is analogous to the situation in ecology during the 1960's when many apparent 'for the good of the species' adaptations were explained at lower levels of selection.

Gaia and the colonization of Mars	1993	The Gaia hypothesis states that the atmosphere, hydrosphere, surface sediments, and life on Earth behave dynamically as a single integrated physiological system.  What has been traditionally viewed as the passive environment is a highly active, integral part of the gaian system.  Aspects of the surface temperature and chemistry are regulated by the sum of life, the biota.  Formulated first by James E. Lovelock, in the late 1960s, the Gaia hypothesis has been in the scientific literature for more than 25 years.  Because of its properties of exponential growth and propagation, life is a powerful geologic force.  A useful aspect of the Gaia idea is that it requires integration of scientific disciplines for the study of Earth.  The recently touted Earth system science is broadly parallel with the gaian concept of the physiochemical regulation of Earth's surface.  We discuss here, in a gaian context, the colonization of Mars by Earth organisms.  Although colonizing Mars may be impossible, its accomplishment would be exactly equivalent to "the reproduction of Gaia by budding."

Gaia: goddess and idea.	1993	This paper introduces Gaia theory to the general reader. It provides the necessary background to follow the development of James Lovelock's thinking as he originated the Gaia theory by comparison of the atmospheres around Mars and other planets during his sojourn at NASA. Lynn Margulis' contributions to Gaia are also presented and the bases for her collaboration with Lovelock explored. In addition to descriptions of the discoveries stimulated by Gaia thinking, the paper indicates how Gaians have dealt with the controversies that have arisen over the theory. Finally, the paper touches on the broader aspects of the Gaia idea. Namely, its development into a spiritual elixir, and how it has been a launching platform for interdisciplinary thinking inside of and beyond the boundaries of the sciences.

The one in the offing, in contrast to those of the past, is set off by man himself. The high speed of change indicated here is especially problematic, because the speed of vegetation adaptation can probably not keep up with it.

Beyond Gaia: Thermodynamics of life and earth system functioning	2004	Are there any general principles that govern the way in which life affects Earth system functioning? Most prominently, the Gaia hypothesis addresses this question by proposing that near-homeostatic conditions on Earth have been maintained “by and for the biosphere.” Here the role of the biota in the Earth system is described from a viewpoint of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, particularly with respect to the hypothesis of maximum entropy production (MEP). It is argued that the biota introduce additional degrees of freedom to Earth system processes. Therefore, we should expect biotic activity, and Earth system processes affected by the biota, to evolve to states of MEP. The consistent effects of the biota on entropy production are demonstrated with a conceptual model of biogeochemical cycling, by using extreme climate model simulations of a “Desert World” and a “Green Planet”, and by a simple coupled climate-carbon cycle model. It is shown that homeostatic behavior can emerge from a state of MEP associated with the planetary albedo. This thermodynamic perspective is then discussed in the context of the original Gaia hypothesis and in light of a recent discussion in Climatic Change. Potential implications of the MEP hypothesis for global change research are also discussed. It is concluded that the resulting behavior of a biotic Earth at a state of MEP may well lead to near-homeostatic behavior of the Earth system on long time scales, as stated by the Gaia hypothesis. However, here homeostasis is a result of the application of the MEP hypothesis to biotically influenced processes rather than a postulate. Besides providing a fundamental perspective on homeostasis, the MEP hypothesis also provides a framework to understand why photosynthetic life would be a highly probable emergent characteristic of the Earth system and why the diversity of life is an important characteristic of Earth system functioning.

Speciation in the Savi Pine Vole, Microtus-Savii (Desel L) (Rodentia, Arvicolidae) - a Theoretical Biology Approach	1995	A theoretical approach to the problem of speciation is developed starting from Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis. In this hypothesis the metaphor of the Biosphere as-a organism is present. Developing the metaphor implies that evolution is the way the Biosphere maintains dynamic homeostasis, and speciation has the adaptive value of an increase of biological diversity. An experimental analysis carried out on speciation in the Savi pine vole suggests that the speciation event is connected with heterochromatin amplification in sex chromosomes of these incipient species. Do gene amplifications have adaptive value! A working hypothesis where amplification is a way to start the speciation process, and where speciation has the adaptive value of increasing diversity, is proposed.

How Pervasive is Coevolution?	1982	Coevolution occurs on a very broad scale and may comprise most of evolution. At the community level the limitation of available free energy promotes coevolution. Coevoltuion commonly occurs as a result of interaction among different levels, time scales, and areas of nationarl selection. Not all levels commonly distringuished are selectively distinct, and coupling among levels are often confused with phemonena within levels. Patch selection may cause previously puzzling phemonena, but neither it nor any other cause is available for the Gaia hypothesis. Despite its predictive successes, Gaia fails as a scientific explanation.	Coevolution	{u'scopus': u'2-s2.0-0013503812'}	http://www.mendeley.com/research/pervasive-coevolution
Quantitative assessment of organism–environment couplings	2009	The evolutionary implications of environmental change due to organismic action remain a controversial issue, after a decadeslong debate on the subject. Much of this debate has been conducted in qualitative fashion, despite the availability of mathematical models for organismenvironment interactions, and for gene frequencies when allele fitness can be related to exploitation of a particular environmental resource. In this article we focus on representative models dealing with niche construction, ecosystem engineering, the Gaia Hypothesis and community interactions of LotkaVolterra type, and show that their quantitative character helps bring into sharper focus the similarities and differences among their respective theoretical contexts.

Requisite variety: more on Gaia	2009	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to mention a set of suggestions for analysing the current financial crisis, but with reservations about the usefulness of one based on Ashby's principle of requisite variety. The reservations are supported by reference to a mechanism of chemotaxis in bacteria. A recent publication concerning the Gaia hypothesis and global warming is reviewed. Design/methodology/approach - The aim is to review developments on the internet, especially those of general cybernetic interest. Findings - The significance of complexity, in government and management, is not disputed, but doubts are expressed about validity of laws that are purported to treat it quantitatively. A pessimistic view of world future is due to James Lovelock, the originator of the Gaia hypothesis, though there is some reason to believe he is more hopeful than is suggested in an interview. Practical implications - The reservations about Ashby's treatment of complexity are essentially theoretical and do not negate findings based on its robust and imprecise application. Lovelock indicates a means of saving the Earth from disastrous climate change but has little hope that it will be implemented. Originality/value - It is hoped this is a valuable periodic review.

Open systems living in a closed biosphere: a new paradox for the Gaia debate.	1990	While energetically open, the biosphere is appreciably closed from the standpoint of matter exchange. Matter cycling and recycling is hence a necessary and emergent property of the global-scale system known as Gaia. But how can an aggregate of open-system life forms have evolved and persisted for billions of years within a planetary system that is largely closed to matter influx and outflow? The puzzling nature of a closed yet persistent biosphere draws our attention to the course of evolution of fundamental metabolic strategies and matter-capture techniques. It suggests a facet of the Gaia hypothesis, framed in terms of persistence. The oceans, atmosphere, soils and biota constitute a complex system which maintains and adjusts matter cycling and recycling within the constraints of planetary closure such that open-system forms of life can persist. This weaker version of the Gaia hypothesis may be useful because it readily lends itself to at least one form of test. What is the solution to the closed biosphere puzzle, and does it indicate that Gaia merits status as a discrete entity? We suggest several disciplines within the field of biology that might provide tools and perspectives toward reaching a solution. These disciplines include artificial closed ecosystems, prokaryote evolution, the nexus of thermodynamics and evolutionary biology, and hierarchy theory in ecosystem modeling and evolution theory.

On the absence of solar evolution-driven warming through the Phanerozoic	2014	Reconstructed temperatures through the Phanerozoic indicate a gradual cooling or, at best, no significant temperature trend, despite a 4.4% increase in solar heating. It is possible that an underlying warming trend has simply been swamped by ‘noise’ due to significant data-errors and/or natural fluctuations. Alternatively, the lack of warming may indicate cooling by biological and/or geological processes, which happen to have the right amplitude to cancel the effects of solar warming. This paper demonstrates that the absence of Phanerozoic warming cannot be explained as a warming trend hidden by noise. It also shows that, given widely accepted estimates of climate sensitivity, it cannot be explained as cancellation by negative feedback in the climate system. The Gaia hypothesis, anthropic selection or some other unconventional mechanism may therefore have to be invoked to explain the absence of long-term warming through the Phanerozoic.

Testing the effect of life on earth's functioning: How Gaian is the earth system?	2002	The Gaia hypothesis of Lovelock states that life regulates Earth's functioning for its own benefit, maintaining habitable, or even optimum conditions for life. But what is beneficial? What is good for one species, may be bad for another. Problems associated with this important, but ill-defined hypothesis make it difficult to test. In order to address these problems and make the concept of Gaia testable, I give a precise definition of terms. Based on these definitions, I put forward four null hypotheses, describing increasing beneficial effects of life on the conditions of Earth, ranging from an Antigaian to an optimising Gaian null hypothesis. I list some indications for rejection of all but one hypothesis, and conclude that life has indeed a strong tendency to affect Earth in a way which enhances the overall benefit (that is, carbon uptake). However, this does not imply that the biota regulates Earth's environment for its own benefit.

Succession in a microbial mat community:  a gaian perspective.	1984	The Gaia hypothesis originally proposed by James E. Lovelock states that the composition, oxidation-reduction state and temperature of the troposphere are actively regulated by the activities of the biota.  The gaian concept has been extrapolated to include the composition of surface sediments through the process of biomineralization.  The stratified microbial community dominated by the cyanobacterium Microcoleus chthonoplastes is actively involved in the deposition of laminated sediments at Laguna Figueroa, Baja California, Mexico.  Unusually heavy rains in the winters of 1979 and 1980 flooded the evaporite flat with up to 3 meters of meteoric water and deposited 5-10 cm of allocthonous sediment.  The composition of the microbial community changed as a succession of dominating microbial species ensued, ultimately leading to the recolonization of the surface sediment by the original Microcoleus-dominated community.  The resiliency of bacterial communities is suggested to be an important mechanism of gaian control systems.

Building a New Dream with Gaia?	2000	A feminist describes a personal transformation over 30 years that has led her to include both human & nonhuman entities under the feminist umbrella, maintaining that nature, like women, has become a cultural & political historical subject. In the 1970s, feminists tended to defend their own bodies, with the environment serving as a backdrop to struggles against a capitalized biomedical assault. The Gaia hypothesis, which views the whole world as one living system, is described, along with differences in the feminisms of North & South. It is suggested that the increasing participation of feminists in biopolitics led to the beginnings of a synergistic relation of feminism with environmentalism. However, increased poverty among women stemming from global shifts in the structuring of production, the collapse of the Soviet system, & the rise of poststructuralist feminisms have resulted in erosion of the solidarity between activist/intellectual feminists & working-class/poor women. The potential for a new global sisterhood based on the Gaian realization of an entire biosocial system at risk is discussed. J.

Indifferent Globality: Gaia, Symbiosis and 'Other Worldliness'	2010	Nigel Clark’s ‘ex-orbitant globality’ concerns the incalculability of other-than-human forces we typically fail to acknowledge, yet which haunt all considerations of environmental change. This article considers Gaia theory as a useful heuristic to register the ubiquity of bacteria to environmental activity and regulation. Bacteria are Gaia theory’s fundamental actants, and through symbiosis and symbiogenesis, connect life and matter in biophysical and biosocial entanglements. Emphasizing symbiosis might invoke the expectation of a re-inscription of the human insofar as the ubiquitous inter-connectivity of life ultimately connects everything to the human. I want to argue toward the opposite conclusion: that bacterial liveliness suggests a profound indifference to human life. As such, symbiosis does not efface difference, nor its vigorous refusal to be absorbed within human formulations of world-remaking, including environmental change. Bacterial indifference’s radical asymmetry suggests the need for non-human centred theories of globality.

Self organization and th emgency of complexity in ecological systems	2005	What explains the remarkable reguarities in distribution and abundance of species, in size distribution of organisms, or in patterns of nutrient use? How does the biosphere maintain exactly the right conditions for life as we know it? Gaia theory postulates that the biota regulates conditions at levels it needs for survival, but evolutionary biologists reject this explanation because it lacks a mechanistic basis. Similarly, the notion of self-organized criticality fails to recognize the importance of the heterogeneity and modularity of ecological sstems. Ecosystems and the biosphere are complex adaptive systems, in which pattern emerges from, and feeds back to affect, the actions of adaptive individual agents, and in which cooperation and multicellularity can develop and provide the regulation of local environments, and indeed impose regularity at higher levels. The history of the bioshpere is a history of coevolution between organisms and their enviroments, across multiple scales of space, time, and complexity.

Slanted truths: Essays on gaia, symbiosis and evolution	1998	Lynn Margulis, one of the most provocative scientific thinkers of our time, and her son, the writer Dorion Sagan, here present a selection from their many essays published in the last decade and a half. Margulis's scientific contributions are legendary. Her proposal that eukaryotic cells (the cells of all multicellular animals and plants) are made up of symbiotic unions of more primitive cells was at first widely derided but is now mainstream science. She has described the previously unrecognized role microbial life plays in the maintenance of all life on earth. And she is, with James Lovelock, one of the founders of Gaia theory. In these essays, perhaps better than in any of her other books, one can see how these apparently unrelated interests combine into a single, coherent scientific world-view about the natural tendency of living systems to form complex interactive communities. This is Margulis and Sagan's fourth book.

Introduction to Ecopsychology: Science, Totems, and the Technological Species	2013	We need nature for our physical and psychological well-being. Our actions reflect this when we turn to beloved pets for companionship, vacation in spots of natural splendor, or spend hours working in the garden. Yet we are also a technological species and have been since we fashioned tools out of stone. Thus one of this century's central challenges is to embrace our kinship with a more-than-human world -- "our totemic self" -- and integrate that kinship with our scientific culture and technological selves. This book takes on that challenge and proposes a reenvisioned ecopsychology. Contributors consider such topics as the innate tendency for people to bond with local place; a meaningful nature language; the epidemiological evidence for the health benefits of nature interaction; the theory and practice of ecotherapy; Gaia theory; ecovillages; the neuroscience of perceiving natural beauty; and sacred geography. Taken together, the essays offer a vision for human flourishing and for a more grounded and realistic environmental psychology. The hardcover edition does not include a dust jacket.

A geophysiologist's thoughts on the natural sulphur cycle	1997	The climate depends on the atmospheric abundance of sulphur aerosols at all levels up to the stratopause. Volcanoes, combustion and biological emissions all contribute and usually result in cooling. The history of this topic is lively and goes back at least to the eighteenth century with Benjamin Franklin's comments on the cooling effects of the sulphuric acid aerosol from the Icelandic volcano, Laki. Mitchell first drew attention to the potential cooling effects of combustion aerosols. Charlson and his colleagues proposed that emissions of dimethyl sulphide (DMS) from ocean algae might also be important. More recently, Lovelock and Kump drew attention to the decline of biological sulphur emissions with global warming and the possible consequence of a positive feedback on climate change. The geophysiological aspects, which arose from the Gaia hypothesis in the early 1970s, form an important part of the account that follows.

Does sustainable development depend on competition or collaboration? The case of darwin versus gaia	1993	Charles Darwin depicted a world which was highly competitive, with the weak unable to survive, and the fittest being successful. This paper contends that many human organizations base their strategies on a Darwinian perspective; however, the paper puts forward an alternative, namely that of the Gaian theory of evolution. The latter should lead to a less short-sighted, more collaborative future, it is maintained. The Gaia hypothesis states that organisms do have the ability to transform the environment to satisfy their needs, but that the system as a whole must be respected to ensure mutual survival. Development in this context may not then occur only as a response to a 'win' at any cost attitude, but by satisfaction of all the various stakeholders in the process, via collaboration and shared responsibility, thus facilitating long term sustainable human development.

The theory of evolution: 150 years afterwards	2009	The introduction of the theory of evolution by natural selection marks a fundamental shift in human thinking. Darwin himself said it was like confessing to murder. Afterwards earlier ideas about life in the past crashed one after another. Since 1859 there have been other shifts: from awareness of deep time and space to tectonic plate movement to earth systems science and the Gaia hypothesis. Evolution theory has of course been modified over the years with greater understanding of the mechanics of genetic inheritance and the role of symbiosis in selection. Even if there is still a handful of people who challenge it on religious or crypto religious grounds, very few can now take them seriously. Evolution methodology has applications beyond biology, for example in the field of technology. Above all it is a verifiable interpretation of continuous change in the development of life on Earth, which is in no way contrary to the 2nd law of thermodynamics. As T.H. Huxley, Darwin's friend and advocate, once remarked: how stupid it was of him not to have thought of it himself.

Gaia as seen through the atmosphere	1972	Life can flourish only within a narrowly circumscribed range of physical and chemical states and since life began the Earth has kept within this range. This is remarkable for there have been major perturbations such as a progressive increase in solar luminosity, extensive changes in the surface and atmospheric chemical composition and the impact of many planetesimals. The anomalous and chemically unstable composition of the Earth's atmosphere when compared with those of the other terrestrial planets was the first indication of homeostasis by the biota to maintain conditions favourable for their continued survival. This paper will discuss recent evidence in support of the Gaia hypothesis and present a simple model of a planetary ecosystem in which homeostasis is a direct and automatic result of the characteristic properties of life.

Frank H.

In ecosystem ecology, the Odumian paradigm emphasizes the concept of emergence, but it has not been accompanied by the creation of a method that fully respects the complexity of the objects studied. In landscape ecology, although the emergentist, multi-level, triadic methodology of J.K. Feibleman and D.T. Campbell has gained acceptance, the importance of emergent properties is still undervalued. In global ecology, the Gaia hypothesis is an expression of an organicist metaphor, while the emergentist terminology used is incongruent with the underlying physicalist cybernetics. More generally, an analytico-additional methodology and the reduction of the properties of ecosystems to the laws of physical chemistry render purely formal any assertion about the emergentist and holistic nature of the ecological systems studied.

Methanogenesis, fires and the regulation of atmospheric oxygen.	1978	The Gaia hypothesis states that the composition, oxidation-reduction potential and the temperature of the Earth's lower atmosphere are modulated by and for the biota living on the surface (Lovelock, 1972; Margulis and Lovelock, 1974). A corollary is that atmospheric oxygen is presently regulated at about 21% for the dominant life forms today: vascular plants and metazoa. We suggest that the enormous annual production of methane (of the order of 1014 mol) is directly related to the short term modulation of oxygen concentration. Atmospheric oxygen results from the burial of reduced carbon; methanogenesis and subsequent atmospheric oxidation of methane prevents that burial. We also present experimental work on the probability of ignition of vegetation as a function of increasing oxygen concentration (Watson, 1978). Both the experiments and consideration of the fossil record lead us to conclude that oxygen has been regulated by methane (and perhaps by N2O and others) at about 10–25% for very long periods relative to the atmospheric residence times of these reactive gases.

Creativity and organizational learning as means to foster sustainability	2014	This article argues that creativity and organizational learning can help to challenge the traditional Newtonian and Cartesian mental models and foster more sustainable societies. The recognition and acceptance of creativity by individuals, groups, organizations, and finally society can create new knowledge and metanoia. Creativity helps to break through the knowledge barrier of current reductionist mental models, while learning helps to consolidate and institutionalize the new mental models. This is especially the case where learning questions underlying assumptions and develops new theories and methodologies that constantly challenge the status quo for the present and the future, instead of mere reaction to immediate problems. Eventually, these mental models would need to be questioned by future creative thinkers in a continuous process; hence, solving today's problems with tomorrow's ideas, and ensuring progress towards more sustainable societies. The paper takes the example of Gaia theory to illustrate how creativity can be institutionalized.

Midwife to the greens: the electron capture detector.	1997	James E. Lovelock makes an account of the path he has followed since he started his scientific research at the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) in London in the 1940s, emphasizing the aspects related to environmental sciences. Lovelock explains the origins of the electron capture detector (ECD). So far, the ECD is the most sensitive, easily portable and inexpensive analytical apparatus capable of detecting substances present in the atmosphere at concentrations as low as parts per trillion (10(-12)). It has been the first device specifically sensitive to pollutants, and its use has provided the grounds for the development of environmental sciences, and green politics. The data gathered by the ECD about the persistence of pesticides in the environment led American biologist Rachel Carson to write her seminal book Silent Spring; data regarding the global presence of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) in the atmosphere led Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina to develop their theory of ozone depletion. The results of his research over the years led Lovelock himself to the development of the Gaia theory.

Testing gaia: The effect of life on earth's habitability and regulation	2002	The Gaia theory proposes that the Earth system self-regulates in a habitable state. Here the effect of life on the state of the Earth and its response to forcing and perturbation is considered. It is argued that life has not survived for >3.8 billion years purely by chance, rather the Earth system possesses regulatory mechanisms. The Earth system is more resistant and resilient to many (but not all) perturbations with life present and the Earth is predicted to remain inhabitable for longer with life present than it would without. With only one case to study, it is difficult to test whether the Earth exhibits such regulation by chance or because regulatory outcomes of life-environment interaction are more probable. The search for life on extra-solar planets and `artificial life' simulations of virtual worlds may increase the sample size. Theoretical principles suggest that regulation is a probable outcome of life-environment coupling, and on Earth it appears that there may be an innate tendency for regulatory properties to accumulate and strengthen as the biota evolves.

Darwinian Daisyworld.	1998	The Daisyworld model was developed to show that organisms can collectively regulate the global environment without assuming conscious or altruistic behaviour, i.e. that Gaia is feasible. We studied the effects of adaptive evolution of Daisyworld by allowing daisies to shift their optimal growth temperatures toward the prevailing temperature. This estimates Daisyworld's homeostatic ability, suggesting a trade-off between the ability of organisms to collectively regulate the environment and the abilities of evolving genotypes to adapt to it.

Evaporation research—a critical review and its lessons for the environmental sciences	1994	Abstract There have been few significant advances in our knowledge of evaporation on an environmental scale during the past 4 decades, a state of affairs linked to the concurrent sterility of research in hydrology and the related environmental sciences. Furthermore, almost none of the advances have been used successfully in practice. This means that we can provide only trivial or dubious answers to important environmental questions. A critical review, based on a quarter century of research on evaporation, has indicated that much of the superficiality of the environmental sciences can be attributed to inappropriate methodologies and the application of linear cause?and?effect ways of thinking to the cybernetic feedback mechanisms that prevail in environmental systems. The resultant problems are particularly evident in the application of small?scale processes to large, environmentally significant areas and in the application of mechanistic concepts to the interactions between plants and their environments. A discussion of examples from studies in evaporation leads to the suggestion that we need a completely new approach that would recognize that a biological system can differ from a physical system, that a large?scale system can differ from the sum of its individual components, and that a forest is not just a collection of trees. Such an approach is exemplified in the Gaia hypothesis, in the accomplishments of the Bergen School of Meteorology during the 1920s and in the development of the complementary relationship between potential and actual areal evaporation.\nAbstract There have been few significant advances in our knowledge of evaporation on an environmental scale during the past 4 decades, a state of affairs linked to the concurrent sterility of research in hydrology and the related environmental sciences.

HCI Remixed: Reflections on Works That Have Influenced the HCI Community	2008	Over almost three decades, the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) has produced a rich and varied literature. Although the focus of attention today is naturally on new work, older contributions that played a role in shaping the trajectory and character of the field have much to tell us. The contributors to HCI Remixed were asked to reflect on a single work at least ten years old that influenced their approach to HCI. The result is this collection of fifty-one short, engaging, and idiosyncratic essays, reflections on a range of works in a variety of forms that chart the emergence of a new field. An article, a demo, a book: any of these can solve a problem, demonstrate the usefulness of a new method, or prompt a shift in perspective. HCI Remixed offers us glimpses of how this comes about. The contributors consider such HCI classics as Sutherland's Sketchpad, Englebart's demo of NLS, and Fitts on Fitts' Lawand such forgotten gems as Pulfer's NRC Music Machine, and Galloway and Rabinowitz's Hole in Space. Others reflect on works somewhere in between classic and forgottenKidd's "The Marks Are on the Knowledge Worker," King Beach's "Becoming a Bartender," and others.

Soils as biotic constructs favouring net primary productivity	1993	Many, if not most, physical and chemical properties of soils required for plant growth are affected strongly by biotic processes. Feedback processes involving primary producers and decomposers may be involved in the development of properties that favour net primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. However, both constructive and destructive effects of biota on soils can be observed. Apparently, effects favouring net primary production have accumulated and presently prevail in the various terrestrial ecosystems of the world. In some ecosystems, however, the dominant vegetation gains competitive advantage by making soils un “favourable” for most other plants. Ombrotrophic peat bogs and heathlands are cases in point. On the global scale, biotic processes can be seen as responsible for the persistence of water on the earth, through control of the earth's surface temperature under the influence of greenhouse gases. As a result, therefore, the large-scale geochemical and hydrological cycles, which are essential for chemical rejuvenation of the earth's surface, also depend on life processes. This is an aspect of Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis, which states that the earth has evolved over geologic time by feedback processes keeping the earth in a state comfortable for life by the action of living organisms. While the development of soils with “favourable” properties may be explained in evolutionary terms, such an explanation apparently does not suffice for the development of Gaia as a whole.

Tides and the evolution of planetary habitability.	2008	Tides raised on a planet by the gravity of its host star can reduce the planet's orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity. This effect is only relevant for planets orbiting very close to their host stars. The habitable zones of low-mass stars are also close in, and tides can alter the orbits of planets in these locations. We calculate the tidal evolution of hypothetical terrestrial planets around low-mass stars and show that tides can evolve planets past the inner edge of the habitable zone, sometimes in less than 1 billion years. This migration requires large eccentricities (>0.5) and low-mass stars ( less or similar to 0.35 M(circle)). Such migration may have important implications for the evolution of the atmosphere, internal heating, and the Gaia hypothesis. Similarly, a planet that is detected interior to the habitable zone could have been habitable in the past. We consider the past habitability of the recently discovered, approximately 5 M(circle) planet, Gliese 581 c. We find that it could have been habitable for reasonable choices of orbital and physical properties as recently as 2 Gyr ago. However, when constraints derived from the additional companions are included, most parameter choices that indicate past habitability require the two inner planets of the system to have crossed their mutual 3:1 mean motion resonance. As this crossing would likely have resulted in resonance capture, which is not observed, we conclude that Gl 581 c was probably never habitable.

Testing anthropic selection: a climate change example.	2011	Planetary anthropic selection, the idea that Earth has unusual properties since, otherwise, we would not be here to observe it, is a controversial idea. This paper proposes a methodology by which to test anthropic proposals by comparison of Earth to synthetic populations of Earth-like planets. The paper illustrates this approach by investigating possible anthropic selection for high (or low) rates of Milankovitch-driven climate change. Three separate tests are investigated: (1) Earth-Moon properties and their effect on obliquity; (2) Individual planet locations and their effect on eccentricity variation; (3) The overall structure of the Solar System and its effect on eccentricity variation. In all three cases, the actual Earth/Solar System has unusually low Milankovitch frequencies compared to similar alternative systems. All three results are statistically significant at the 5% or better level, and the probability of all three occurring by chance is less than 10(-5). It therefore appears that there has been anthropic selection for slow Milankovitch cycles. This implies possible selection for a stable climate, which, if true, undermines the Gaia hypothesis and also suggests that planets with Earth-like levels of biodiversity are likely to be very rare.

Maximum entropy production in environmental and ecological systems.	2010	The coupled biosphere-atmosphere system entails a vast range of processes at different scales, from ecosystem exchange fluxes of energy, water and carbon to the processes that drive global biogeochemical cycles, atmospheric composition and, ultimately, the planetary energy balance. These processes are generally complex with numerous interactions and feedbacks, and they are irreversible in their nature, thereby producing entropy. The proposed principle of maximum entropy production (MEP), based on statistical mechanics and information theory, states that thermodynamic processes far from thermodynamic equilibrium will adapt to steady states at which they dissipate energy and produce entropy at the maximum possible rate. This issue focuses on the latest development of applications of MEP to the biosphere-atmosphere system including aspects of the atmospheric circulation, the role of clouds, hydrology, vegetation effects, ecosystem exchange of energy and mass, biogeochemical interactions and the Gaia hypothesis. The examples shown in this special issue demonstrate the potential of MEP to contribute to improved understanding and modelling of the biosphere and the wider Earth system, and also explore limitations and constraints to the application of the MEP principle.

Half a billion years of good weather: Gaia or good luck?	2007	For the past 550 million years, Earth has had a relatively stable climate, with average global temperatures generally fluctuating by Less than 10 degrees C from the present value of around 15 degrees C. In the preceding 4 billion years, temperature fluctuations were almost an order of magnitude greater One explanation for climate stability is that the biosphere evolves to maintain optimum conditions for Life (the Gaia hypothesis). But this stability could also result from luck and, without such good fortune, conditions on Earth would have been unsuitable for the evolution of complex Life: anthropic selection, in other words. One element of such good Luck concerns the climatic impact of the Moon; the properties of the Earth-Moon system only just allow a stable rotation axis for the Earth (considered a prerequisite for climate stability and the evolution of complex Life). Axial stability also requires Jupiter and Saturn to be widely spaced, offering a test of the rarity or otherwise of the solar system arrangement among exoplanet systems. Gravitational. microlensing surveys should allow this to be tested within a decade.

Gaia's handmaidens: The Orlog model for conservation biology	2005	The Gaia hypothesis, which proposes that Earth's biota and material environment form a self-regulating system, has been influential in conservation biology, but it has not translated into specific guidelines. Proponents of phylogenetics and ecology often claim primacy over the foundations of conservation biology, a debate that has deep roots in philosophy and science. A more recent claim is that conservation efforts should protect evolutionary processes that will allow diversification. Phylogenetics, ecology, and evolution all have legitimate roles in conservation, when viewed in a temporal perspective. Phylogenetic studies identify the bioheritage of past species radiations, ecology preserves the life-support systems for these lineages in the present, and evolutionary processes allow adaptation of these lineages to novel challenges in the future. The concept of temporal domains in conservation (past, present, future) has an appropriate metaphor in the Norse worldview known as the Orlog. In this body of mythology, three sisters tend the tree of life and fend off a dragon gnawing at the roots. The names of these sisters, Urd, Verdandi, and Skuld, translate to Past, Present, and Future. In Viking mythology, the threads of life cannot persist without the cooperation of these sisters. In the science of conservation biology, they represent the handmaidens of Gaia-three scientific disciplines that can succeed only with a spirit of familial cooperation.

The existentialities of biodiversity conservation	2000	Much has been written in recent years about the need to conserve biodiversity but few papers have highlighted the existentiality of biodiversity to human existence. Not only does it provide a wide range of goods, many of which are self-evidently essential to humans, but it also provides vital ecosystem services which comprise the regulation of global biogeochemical cycles. Recent research has emphasized the role of species diversity in these vital services, with the implication that species extinction may ultimately compromise the existence of humankind. Nevertheless, the transformation of natural ecosystems, notably forest/woodlands, continues apace at a time when the first positive signs of global warming are emerging which, in turn, reflects a substantial perturbation to the global biogeochemical cycle of carbon. With the global population set to increase by c.46 per cent in the next thirty years, the threat to the world's remaining biodiversity will undoubtedly intensify. Consequently, the potential for the provision of goods through, for example, biotechnology will be limited as will the ability of the biosphere to regulate biogeochemical cycles and hence climate. Amongst the ideas referred to in this paper are Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis and Vernadsky's noosphere, though neither refer overtly to the existentialities of biodiversity.

Huntington and Lovelock: Climatic Determinism in the 20th Century	2004	Two scholars of the past century illustrate the changing yet lingering role of deterministic ideas in climatology. Early in the 20th century, Ellsworth Huntington wrote of the impact of climate on civilization and of climatic change on history and society. His claims were largely dismissed as being sweeping conjecture rather than demonstrable fact. Nevertheless, he was the leading proponent of the school of thought referred to as environmental determinism. His ideas received less attention as the discipline of geography moved in new directions in the 1930s. James Lovelock, writing late in the century, claimed that the Earth is a living organism capable of self-regulation. He called this the Gaia hypothesis. The idea of a living Earth was not especially new or controversial. However, he further suggested that the living Earth had powers of self-regulation, and that such cybernetic powers control the composition of the atmosphere and, subsequently, the temperature of the earth. Critics claimed that his proposed system was deterministic or teleological. Collectively, Huntington's and Lovelock's ideas demonstrate a range of deterministic theories in explaining the consequences of climatic processes and are relevant to current global change studies.

The simulated emergence of distributed environmental control in evolving microcosms.	2002	This work continues investigation into Gaia theory [Lovelock, (1995) The ages of Gaia, Oxford University Press] from an artificial life perspective [Downing, (2000) in Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Artificial Life, (pp. 90-99) MIT Press], with the aim of assessing the general compatibility of emergent distributed environmental control with conventional natural selection. Our earlier system, GUILD [Downing and Zvirinsky, (1999) Artificial Life, 5, 291-318], displayed emergent regulation of the chemical environment by a population of metabolizing agents, but the chemical model underlying those results was trivial, essentially admitting all possible reactions at a single energy cost. The new model, METAMIC, utilizes abstract chemistries that are both (a) constrained to a small set of legal reactions, and (b) grounded in basic fundamental relationships between energy, entropy, and biomass synthesis/breakdown. To explore the general phenomena of emergent homeostasis, we generate 100 different chemistries and use each as the basis for several METAMIC runs, as part of a Gaia hunt. This search discovers 20 chemistries that support microbial populations capable of regulating a physical environmental factor within their growth-optimal range, despite the extra metabolic cost. Case studies from the Gaia hunt illustrate a few simple mechanisms by which real biota might exploit the underlying chemistry to achieve some control over their physical environment. Although these results shed little light on the question of Gaia on Earth, they support the possibility of emergent environmental control at the microcosmic level.

The fundamental processes in ecology: a thought experiment on extraterrestrial biospheres.	2003	Ecological science is often organised as a hierarchical series of entities: genes, individuals, populations, species, communities, ecosystems and biosphere. Here, I consider an alternative process-based approach to ecology, and analyse the nature of the fundamental processes in ecology. These fundamental processes are discussed in the context of the following question: 'for any planet with carbon-based life, which persists over geological time scales, what are the minimum set of ecological processes that must be present?' I suggest that the following processes would be present on any such planet: energy flow, multiple guilds, ecological trade-offs leading to within-guild biodiversity, ecological hypercycles, merging of organismal and ecological physiology, carbon sequestration and possibly photosynthesis. Nutrient cycling is described as an emergent property of these fundamental processes. I discuss reasons why a biosphere based on a single species with no nutrient cycling is very unlikely to exist. I also describe the concept of 'Gaian effect'. This suggests that some processes will always tend to extend the lifespan of a biosphere in which they develop (positive Gaian effect) while others could either increase or decrease (negative Gaian effect) such a lifespan. These ideas are discussed in the context of astrobiology, ecosystem services, conservation biology and Gaia theory.

Gaia, God, and the Internet: The History of Evolution and the Utopia of Community in Media Society	2007	The question of religious content in the media has occupied many scholars studying the relationship between media and religion. However, the study of recent religious thought offers a promising perspective for the analysis of the cultural perceptions of various media technologies. After the Internet first appeared in American households in the middle of the 1990s, a variety of religious or spiritual interpretations of the new medium emerged. The far-reaching ideas see the Internet as the first step of the realisation of a divine entity consisting of the collective human mind. In this vision, the emergence of the Internet is considered to be part of a teleological evolutionary model. Essential for the religious and evolutionary construction of the Internet is an incorporation of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's model of evolution - especially the idea of the noosphere, and its adoption in media theory by Marshall McLuhan. The connections of these ideas to James Loveloke's Gaia theory illustrate the notion of the Internet as an organic entity. The article outlines the processes of the reception of religious and evolutionary ideas which led to the recent interpretations of the Internet as a divine sphere.

The Web of Life	1954	The vitality and accessibility of Fritjof Capra's ideas have made him perhaps the most eloquent spokesperson of the latest findings emerging at the frontiers of scientific, social, and philosophical thought. In his international bestsellers \emph{The Tao of Physics} and \emph{The Turning Point,} he juxtaposed physics and mysticism to define a new vision of reality. In \emph{The Web of Life,} Capra takes yet another giant step, setting forth a new scientific language to describe interrelationships and interdependence of psychological, biological, physical, social, and cultural phenomena--the "web of life." During the past twenty-five years, scientists have challenged conventional views of evolution and the organization of living systems and have developed new theories with revolutionary philosophical and social implications. Fritjof Capra has been at the forefront of this revolution. In \emph{The Web of Life,} Capra offers a brilliant synthesis of such recent scientific breakthroughs as the theory of complexity, Gaia theory, chaos theory, and other explanations of the properties of organisms, social systems, and ecosystems. Capra's surprising findings stand in stark contrast to accepted paradigms of mechanism and Darwinism and provide an extraordinary new foundation for ecological policies that will allow us to build and sustain communities without diminishing the opportunities for future generations. Now available in paperback for the first time, \emph{The Web of Life} is cutting-edge science writing in the tradition of James Gleick's \emph{Chaos,} Gregory Bateson's \emph{Mind and Matter,} and Ilya Prigogine's \emph{Order Out of Chaos.}	Soil Science	{u'doi': u'10.1097/00010694-195401000-00030', u'arxiv': u'arXiv:1403.2575v1', u'isbn': u'0385476760', u'scopus': u'2-s2.0-84886770728', u'issn': u'0038-075X'}	http://www.mendeley.com/research/web-life-6

Evaporation Research — A Critical Review and its Lessons for the Environmental Sciences	1994	There have been few significant advances in our knowledge of evaporation on an environmental scale during the past 4 decades, a state of affairs linked to the concurrent sterility of research in hydrology and the related environmental sciences. Furthermore, almost none of the advances have been used successfully in practice. This means that we can provide only trivial or dubious answers to important environmental questions. A critical review, based on a quarter century of research on evaporation, has indicated that much of the superficiality of the environmental sciences can be attributed to inappropriate methodologies and the application of linear cause-and-effect ways of thinking to the cybernetic feedback mechanisms that prevail in environmental systems. The resultant problems are particularly evident in the application of small-scale processes to large, environmentally significant areas and in the application of mechanistic concepts to the interactions between plants and their environments. A discussion of examples from studies in evaporation leads to the suggestion that we need a completely new approach that would recognize that a biological system can differ from a physical system, that a large-scale system can differ from the sum of its individual components, and that a forest is not just a collection of trees. Such an approach is exemplified in the Gaia hypothesis, in the accomplishments of the Bergen School of Meteorology during the 1920s and in the development of the complementary relationship between potential and actual areal evaporation.

The earth and its life: Systems perspective	1988	From the planetary point of view, the Earth can be imagined as a system comprised of interwined natural populations propagated through time via recycling. This recycling, or 'birth/death' process, imposes age patterns on natural populations of the solid earth, hydrosphere, atmosphere and living entities. Mathematically, the concept is analogous to that of population dynamics in living systems. The populations of the Earth system form a hierarchical structure. The hierarchy of geological tectonic realms contains populations of less than or equal to 10(24)-10(26) gr in size, with half-lives in the 10(7)-10(9) yr time range. The approximate parameters for the oceans are less than or equal to 10(24) gr and 10(2)-10(7) yr, for the atmosphere less than or equal to 10(21) gr and 10(-2)-10(7) yr, and for living systems less than or equal to 10(14)-10(19) gr and 10(-3)-10(-2) yr, respectively. In this perspective, and in departure from the GAIA hypothesis, the subordinate populations, such as those of living systems, are constrained to operate within limits imposed by the larger, and slower, hierarchies. They can overstep the imposed limits only on time scales shorter than the response time of the dominant populations. Isotopic record of past sea water shows that on time scales of 10(7) yr the solid earth, hydrosphere, atmosphere and life act as a unified system controlled by tectonics, that is by the hierarchy of the solid earth.

Secular changes in the modes of carbonate deposition and the stability of the climate system; Geological Society of America, 2003 annual meeting	2003	In the late Phanerozoic, reduction in carbonate deposition on the continental shelves can be compensated for by the increased preservation in deep sea sediments of biogenic carbonate originating from planktic calcifiers living in the open ocean. The result of this is that ocean carbonate chemistry is strongly buffered and the carbon-climate system relatively stable against perturbation of sea level. However, before the advent of biogenic carbonate precipitation by pelagic calcareous plankton and benthic metazoa, carbonate deposition would have been largely restricted to shallow water photic environments. Neoproterozoic ice ages of near-global extent and multi million-year duration can thus be understood as a direct consequence of the weak "buffering" of the Precambrian carbon cycle. We hypothesize that the evolution of calcifying coccolithophores and foraminifera during the early Phanerozoic and associated secular change in the controls on carbonate deposition and ocean chemistry led to a fundamental change in how the Earth's climate system operated. This is arguably the first clear case in which biological evolution has led to increased climate stability--the central tenet of the "Gaia hypothesis". It would appear that a relatively small proportion of all planktic taxa are thus directly responsible for the relative stability of the modern climate system.

Sustainable Design: A Brief Appraisal of its Main Concepts	2012	Research linking design to sustainability surfaced in the 1970s and has since received broad attention in academic and professional literature. Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring from 1962 and the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis from 1974 inspired design, among many other disciplines, to search for an appropriate balance between industrial cultures and natural surroundings. This article tracks a brief idea-historical account of sustainable design theories. Main concepts in the field are consolidated under three criteria: ethics, technology fixes and social interaction. These criteria are considered as the main motivators for research and theory development in sustainable design. Following the Introduction, which gives an overview of concept development in design in general and sustainable design in particular, the second section explains the methodological onset for the analysis and introduces three concepts that represent important trends in sustainable design theory. The three concepts: Papanek’s socially and ecologically responsible design, the Design for the Environment approach, and Manzini’s sustainable everyday philosophy, are analysed in the third section according to the role they assign to the criteria. Further, the section reviews the concepts within a wider debate on sustainable development.

Maximum entropy production in environmental and ecological systems Introduction	2010	The coupled biosphere-atmosphere system entails a vast range of processes\nat different scales, from ecosystem exchange fluxes of energy, water\nand carbon to the processes that drive global biogeochemical cycles,\natmospheric composition and, ultimately, the planetary energy balance.\nThese processes are generally complex with numerous interactions\nand feedbacks, and they are irreversible in their nature, thereby\nproducing entropy. The proposed principle of maximum entropy production\n(MEP), based on statistical mechanics and information theory, states\nthat thermodynamic processes far from thermodynamic equilibrium will\nadapt to steady states at which they dissipate energy and produce\nentropy at the maximum possible rate. This issue focuses on the latest\ndevelopment of applications of MEP to the biosphere-atmosphere system\nincluding aspects of the atmospheric circulation, the role of clouds,\nhydrology, vegetation effects, ecosystem exchange of energy and mass,\nbiogeochemical interactions and the Gaia hypothesis. The examples\nshown in this special issue demonstrate the potential of MEP to contribute\nto improved understanding and modelling of the biosphere and the\nwider Earth system, and also explore limitations and constraints\nto the application of the MEP principle.

Spora and Gaia: how microbes fly with their clouds	1998	We hypothesise that marine algae and various common microbes of the atmosphere (spora) use chemical induction of water condensation to enable or increase their wind dispersal between their aquatic, terrestrial or epiphytic growth sites. Biogenic chemical cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN), sometimes co-occurring in single species (e.g. Pseudomonas syringae), release heat energy of phase change, thus contributing to local air movements that can be used both for lofting and for lateral dispersal of their producers. The phase-change catalysis may occur on the microbial surface (e.g. P. syringae) or may happen more distantly through the release of chemical precursors for suitable ions (e.g. plankton-derived dimethylsulphide [DMS] forming atmospheric sulphate). Small phytoplankton and bacteria take off from water through bubble-burst processes especially in “white-caps”, these often themselves caused by convective winds. Selection for local induction of wind is likely to be most effective at the level of clonal microbial patches. Algal blooms having high DMS emission may represent attempts to create winds for dispersal; if so, algal cell changes occurring in such blooms may have features convergent to terrestrial dispersal cyclomorphoses of aphids, locusts, subcortical insects and others. It is already established that biogenic cloud formation occurs on a scale fully capable of affecting world climate. This fact features prominently in the Gaia Hypothesis. However, in contrast to the evolutionary scenario for microbe dispersal that we present, the claim of an adaptive function at the world level still lacks an explanatory mechanism.

Life as a planetary phenomenon:  the colonization of Mars.	1995	Life is a planet-wide phenomenon in which its components incessantly move and interact. Life imperatively recycles its parts at the surface of the Earth in a chemical transformation and physical transport that depends utterly on the energy from a recent star, the Sun. Humanity, entirely dependent on other beings, plays a recent and relatively small part in the great phenomenon of life that transports and transforms the surface of the Earth. Our species accelerates but does not dominate the metabolism of the Earth system. Ironically, during the Apollo days of the sixties, fears were rampant that Martian or other extraterrestrial "germs" might "contaminate" our planet. After Viking, such fears are seen as the manifestation of cultural paranoia. The Viking missions complemented ground-based astronomical observation and yielded definitive evidence for the lack of life on the red planet. The Gaia hypothesis states that the surface temperature, composition of the reactive gases, oxidation state, alkalinity-acidity on today's Earth are kept homeorrhetically at values set by the sum of the activities of the current biota. Life, in other words, not only produces and maintains its immediate environment, but appears on Earth only as a planetary phenomenon. Since the natural tendency of all life is to grow exponentially to fill proximal volume, the question now "can life ecopoietically expand to Mars?" is entirely equivalent to the query of "can Gaia reproduce?"

Notes from the greenhouse world: A study in coevolution, planetary sustainability, and community structure	2010	This paper explores coevolution and governance of common goods using models of coevolving biospheres, in which adapting populations must collectively regulate their planet's climate or face extinction. The results support the Gaia hypothesis against challenges based on the tragedy of the commons: model creatures are often able to work together to maintain the common good (a suitable climate) without being undermined by "free riders." A long-term dynamics appears in which communities that cannot sustain Gaian cooperation give way to communities that can. This result provides an argument why a Gaia scenario should generally be observed, rather than a tragedy of the commons scenario. Second, a close look at how communities fail reveals failures that do not fit the tragedy of the commons framework and are better described in terms of conflict between differently positioned parties, with power over different aspects of the system. In the context of Norgaard's work, all these observations can be read as narratives of coevolution relevant to social communities as well as ecological ones, contrasting with pessimistic scenarios about common governance and supporting respect for traditional arrangements and restraint in intervention. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Maximum entropy production in environmental and ecological systems	2010	The coupled biosphere–atmosphere system entails a vast range of processes at different scales, from ecosystem exchange fluxes of energy, water and carbon to the processes that drive global biogeochemical cycles, atmospheric composition and, ultimately, the planetary energy balance. These processes are generally complex with numerous interactions and feedbacks, and they are irreversible in their nature, thereby producing entropy. The proposed principle of maximum entropy production (MEP), based on statistical mechanics and information theory, states that thermodynamic processes far from thermodynamic equilibrium will adapt to steady states at which they dissipate energy and produce entropy at the maximum possible rate. This issue focuses on the latest development of applications of MEP to the biosphere–atmosphere system including aspects of the atmospheric circulation, the role of clouds, hydrology, vegetation effects, ecosystem exchange of energy and mass, biogeochemical interactions and the Gaia hypothesis. The examples shown in this special issue demonstrate the potential of MEP to contribute to improved understanding and modelling of the biosphere and the wider Earth system, and also explore limitations and constraints to the application of the MEP principle.

Further studies on the modulation of fossil fuel production by global temperature variations	1994	This study extends the earlier work of Rust and Kirk (1982) on the inverse modulation of global fossil fuel production by variations in Northern Hemispheric temperatures. Recent revisions and extensions of the fuel production record are incorporated and a much improved temperature record is used. The new data are consistent with the predictions of the original Rust- Kirk model which is extended to allow for time lags between variations in the temperature and the corresponding responses in fuel production. The modulation enters the new model through the convolution of a lagged averaging function with the temperature time-series. Explicit terms account for the perturbations caused by the Great Depression and World War II. The final model accounts for 99.84% of the total variance in the production record. The temperature modulation produces variations of as much as 30% in the total production. This modulation represents a feedback which is consistent with the predictions of the Gaia hypothesis for a planetary greenhouse temperature control. The new model calculates 20-y fuel production predictions for three temperature scenarios which hopefully bracket the possibilities for temperature behavior during that time.

Cooperation evolution and self-regulation dynamics in metapopulation: Stage-equilibrium hypothesis	2005	The cause, maintenance and significance of cooperation are the key to understand mutual altruism, one of the most important behavioral strategies in social animals. Differential models based on mean-field assumption and pair approximation and cellular automaton were built on metapopulation framework to reveal the effect of empty patches and multi-behavior strategies on persistence under habitat degradation. (1) The cooperators were always been excluded under mean-field assumption, showing that the coexistence of defective and cooperative behaviors is impossible in well-mixed population. (2) Metapopulation can survive even when colonization rate was lower than extinction rate, due to the compensation of cooperation rewards to extinction debt. (3) With the change of the temptation to defect and other parameters, metapopulation can be pure cooperators, pure defectors, and cooperator-defector coexistence (aggregated cooperators encircled by the defectors with relatively fixed borders). (4) Under habitat destruction, including patch isolation and habitat decay, metapopulation remains constant size through the self-regulation of cooperator-defector frequencies. The habitat improvement is always accompanied contradictorily with the behavioral degradation (more cheaters). Results and literature evidences lead to a stage-equilibrium hypothesis: multi-element system can maintain and stabilize its function and systematic level under environmental stress through the self-regulation of element proportions. It emphasizes the homeostatic utilitarian of diversity, besides narrowly and diffusely utilitarian and ethical impetration. This hypothesis was also compared with Gaia theory, niche construction, ecosystem engineering, and Baldwin effect. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

History of Ecology	2013	Abstract Ernst Haeckel coined the word ‘oecology’ in 1866 for a new science, but relevant observations and ideas had already been accumulating since the ancient Greeks. The balance of nature was the first ecological idea (Egerton, F. N. (1973). Changing concepts of the balance of nature. Quarterly Review of Biology 48, 322–350.); Carl Linnaeus expanded it beyond animals to include plants and named it Oeconomia Naturae. Specialized sciences began to emerge in the early 1800s; among the earliest was phytogeography, founded by Alexander von Humboldt. Evolutionary theories by Lamarck and Charles Darwin were relevant to ecological ideas, since Lamarck thought species evolve rather than become extinct, and Darwin saw competition as a cause of extinction. The roots of the main ecological specializations – plant ecology, animal ecology, limnology, and marine ecology – emerged in the 1800s, and limnology and plant ecology had become organized by the 1890s. These four specializations were developed throughout the 1900s, as were new ones – primarily population ecology and ecosystem ecology. Ecological societies and journals came to the fore in the 1900s, as did institutions and specialized schools in various universities. Biogeochemistry arose in Russia (the USSR) in the early 1900s, and the Gaia theory arose in 1972. After the Second World War, environmentalism became important in all countries, and ecologists were needed as consultants. The International Biological Program (1964–74) produced many publications on ecosystems throughout the world.

The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems	1996	The vitality and accessibility of Fritjof Capra's ideas have made him perhaps the most eloquent spokesperson of the latest findings emerging at the frontiers of scientific, social, and philosophical thought. In his international bestsellers The Tao of Physics and The Turning Point, he juxtaposed physics and mysticism to define a new vision of reality. In The Web of Life, Capra takes yet another giant step, setting forth a new scientific language to describe interrelationships and interdependence of psychological, biological, physical, social, and cultural phenomena-the "web of life."During the past twenty-five years, scientists have challenged conventional views of evolution and the organization of living systems and have developed new theories with revolutionary philosophical and social implications. Fritjof Capra has been at the forefront of this revolution. In The Web of Life, Capra offers a brilliant synthesis of such recent scientific breakthroughs as the theory of complexity, Gaia theory, chaos theory, and other explanations of the properties of organisms, social systems, and ecosystems. Capra's surprising findings stand in stark contrast to accepted paradigms of mechanism and Darwinism and provide an extraordinary new foundation for ecological policies that will allow us to build and sustain communities without diminishing the opportunities for future generations.Now available in paperback for the first time, The Web of Life is cutting-edge science writing in the tradition of James Gleick's Chaos, Gregory Bateson's Mind and Matter, and Ilya Prigogine's Order Out of Chaos.

Green grammar and grammatical metaphor, or language and the myth of power, or metaphors we die by	1996	This paper takes the position that ordinary language, especially the transitive clause, is inadequate to the representation of the world demanded by modern scientific theory, especially ecological theory, and suggests ways in which the grammatical resources of the language can be used and developed to become more adequate. In particular it argues against the position of Halliday and Martin that adequacy can be achieved by science abandoning nominalization or grammatical metaphor, and points out that, on the contrary, these structures emphasize the primacy of process and downplay anthropocentrism. It begins in section 2 by explaining 'grammatical metaphor', showing that congruent and literal language use can be regarded as conventionalized metaphor. It continues by trying to account for the 'naturalness', the Marxist/humanist reality, which we accord to congruent structures, in terms of experientialist accounts of cognitive metaphor. Section 3, after suggesting an experientialist influence on Newtonian dynamics, gives a brief sketch of changes in scientific theory since Newton, leading up to a summary of Gaia theory. Section 4 is the technical core of this paper. It shows that the congruent grammar of transitive material process clauses lacks consonance with modern scientific theory, whether in physics or biology/ecology. And it gives an extended account of how the resources of transitivity/ergativity and grammatical metaphor may be utilised in favour of more consonance. Section 5 sums up, and concludes with some thoughts on the possibilities for an Ecological Critical Discourse Analysis, pointing to radical and less radical alternatives for the future.

Conceptualising global strategic sustainability and corporate transformational change	2009	Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present the concept of global “strategic sustainability”, represented by a conceptual framework, the “spheres of strategic sustainability”. The paper examines routes, solutions and a vision for corporate strategic sustainability in the macro context of the global physical environment and the planet. This builds on previous research identifying key drivers and strategies for corporate sustainability. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is conceptual in nature and underpinned by Gaia theory, ecosystems theory and the laws of thermodynamics. These three offer specific foci for sustainability research including holism, integration and synthesis: without which, sustainability research would be difficult to achieve. Findings – The paper identifies two major domains – “corporate” and “consumer” strategic sustainability. It examines the corporate domain in which routes are identified through responses to existing globalisation, corporate strategy and corporate culture. Research limitations/implications – The paper provides insight and preliminary conceptual development towards a full theoretical model of corporate and consumer strategic sustainability. The framework will guide future conceptual and empirical investigations and broaden and deepen our understanding of how firm’s can construct strategic business models that incorporate sustainability. Originality/value – The paper offers a conceptual framework that develops the concept of “corporate strategic sustainability” and provides positive, practical solutions to incorporating sustainability into business models. It also challenges the current dominant socio-economic paradigm and sets the scene for a more positive eco-paradigm that serves the present and future needs of the planet, environment, businesses and human society.

Self-sustained temperature oscillations on daisyworld	1999	The daisyworld model of Watson and Lovelock demonstrated that a simple biological feedback system involving coupling between black and white daisies and their physical environment can stabilize planetary temperature over a wide range of solar luminosity. Here, we show that the addition of a differential equation for temperature to the original daisyworld model leads to periodic oscillations in temperature about a homeostatic mean. These oscillations, in which the model alternates between dominance by either black or white daisies, arise from the internal dynamics of the system rather than from external forcing. An important criterion for the oscillations to occur is that solar luminosity be within the range in which both daisy species are viable. A second important criterion is that the ratio of the timescales for daisy population turnover and climate system thermal response be bounded. While internally driven oscillations are well known in predator--prey biological models and in coupled ocean energy balance-- cryosphere models, the present study shows that such oscillations also can arise in a model of the biosphere coupled to its physical environment. The potential significance of this result to planet Earth and the science of geophysiology is discussed.

Maximization principles and daisyworld	2004	We investigate whether the equilibrium time-averaged state of a self-organizing system with many internal degrees of freedom, 2D-daisyworld, can be described by optimizing a single quantity. Unlike physical systems where a principle of maximum energy production has been observed, daisyworld follows evolutionary dynamics rather than Hamiltonian dynamics. We find that this is sufficient to invalidate the maximum entropy production principle, finding instead a different principle, that the system self-organizes to a state which maximizes the amount of life. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Cybertectonic Earth and Gaia's weak hand: sedimentary geology, sediment cycling and the Earth system	2007	Tectonics, climate and sea level are dominant controls on the nature and distribution of sedimentary environments. By inverse logic, recognition of influences on sedimentation from the stratigraphic record as a result of perturbations in these variables leads to clarification of past environmental and structural change. The succession of sedimentary environments in time and place is determined by a wider combination of variables; namely, sediment flux, biological evolution, atmosphere and water body productivity and chemistry. The feedbacks and interrelationships between all variables cause the complexity seen in sedimentation processes over geological time. The processes of global tectonics that cause widespread mountain belt and continental plateau uplift have produced numerous  severe' events during Earth history: these often random workings-out of the plate tectonic cycle define the state of  Cybertectonic Earth' (from cyber, after the Greek kubernan: to steer or govern). This has worked within a usually zonally arranged series of climatic belts and within the framework provided by biological evolution. At certain times in the geological past, a combination of factors arose as a response to continental uplift and have acted to cause certain Earth surface conditions and variables (notably mean global surface temperature, atmospheric pCO2, pO2) to have varied by very large amounts (x2-x10) compared with present values. These large fluctuations, such as those responsible for the Neoproterozoic, Late Palaeozoic and late Tertiary glaciations, lead one to doubt the reality of homeostatic control of surface conditions as proposed in Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis. The Gaian kuberne0te0s (steersman) had a weak hand on the helm, frequently unable to prevent vast areas of the globe experiencing rapid fluctuations in environmental conditions and inimical conditions to life for very long periods during Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic times. At the same time, biogenic and abiogenic processes have proved capable of returning Earth to states of mean stability, although biogeochemical cycling models seem alarmingly ad hoc and largely untestable as scientific hypotheses in any true geological sense.

Beyond Environmentalism: A Philosophy of Nature	2008	This one-of-a-kind book provides thoughtful insight into the current relationship between humankind and the environmentBeyond Environmentalism is the first book of its kind to present a timely and relevant analysis of environmentalism. The author's decades of experience as a philosopher of science allow him to critically comprehend scientific issues and to develop and explain sound, ethical policies in response to them. The result is a volume that builds a philosophy of nature and helps the reader assess humankind's relationship with and impact on the world around us.This innovative book discusses the inconsistencies, both scientific and philosophical, of popular environmentalism and sheds new perspectives on the issues, causes, and debates that embrace society today. The goal is not to settle environmental issues once and for all, but rather to provide the basis for more reasoned, scientific, and productive debates. The need for a new philosophy of nature is explored through methodological discussion of several topics, including:The rise and fall of scientific proofNature in religion, romance, and human valuesHumankind's responsibility to the environmentThe value of freedomKinship among speciesNumerous case studies throughout the book delve into global warming, the "sixth extinction," the precautionary principle, pollution, and other popular issues within environmentalism. Feature boxes guide the reader through complex topics such as eco-sabotage, the Gaia hypothesis, and the urban heat-island effect, while vivid illustrations demonstrate scientific data, theories, and philosophical arguments in a reader-friendly manner.With its balanced approach to provocative issues, Beyond Environmentalism serves as an excellent, thought-provoking supplement for courses on environmental studies at the undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also an interesting and accessible read for anyone with a general interest in environmental issues.

Women and animals in affiliative relationship: Healing characteristics of the animal human bond	2010	Gender is a basic organizing principle that profoundly shapes material conditions of women's lives. Ecofeminism posits an association and joint oppression among women, animals, and nature, while feminist methodologies expose previously hidden aspects of women's reality. Despite the emergence of feminist research seeking to uncover the ancient significance of women's affiliative relationships with other animals and nature, peer reviewed literature on healing characteristics of the animal human bond reflects a human centric perspective permeated with the assumptions and biases of a world view that devalues animals, women, and nature. This study is an investigation of the ways in which the animal human bond sustains and nourishes women in the absence of meaningful human relationships. Using a qualitative, phenomenological approach, five participants describe their healing connections with animal companions from their perspective and experience of mutually interdependent, reciprocal animal human bonding. Reflecting a world view consistent with the ethos of ecofeminism and ecopsychology, participants voice a reality of healing affiliative bonds with animals that refutes assumptions of a human centric bias inherent in much of the current research. The results from this study support the assumptions of Gaia theory (Lovelock, 1988) and the biophilia hypothesis (Wilson 1984). As such study results provide an alternative perspective on animal human bonding that diverges from a human centric view of nature and animals. What are the characteristics of the animal human bond that create healing for women? Can animal human bonds serve as a correlate for nature in healing the wound of lost human affiliations? How might recognition and validation of this ancient bond shift social evaluation of women, animals, and nature? Finally, how might women's insight and wisdom gained in affiliative relationship with the animal world enhance our understanding of human society? Elders throughout history have recognized the natural, healthy development of reciprocal animal human bonds as an integral aspect of the human world. The results of this study validate the healing efficacy of reciprocal animal human bonding for women, animals, and nature, while also indicating a need for an interdisciplinary theory of psychosocial development firmly rooted in the ecological context from which all life springs.

Catastrophic desert formation in Daisyworld	2003	Feedback between life and its environment is ubiquitous but the strength of coupling and its global implications remain hotly debated. Abrupt changes in the abundance of life for small changes in forcing provide one indicator of regulation, for example, when vegetation-climate feedback collapses in the formation of a desert. Here we use a two-dimensional "Daisyworld" model with curvature to show that catastrophic collapse of life under gradual forcing provides a testable indicator of environmental feedback. When solar luminosity increases to a critical value, a desert forms across a wide band of the planet. The scale of collapse depends on the strength of feedback. The efficiency of temperature regulation is limited by mutation rate in an analogous manner to the limitation of adaptive fitness in evolutionary theories. The final state of the system emerging from single-site rules can be described by two global quantities: optimization of temperature regulation and maximization of diversity, which are mathematically analogous to energy and entropy in thermodynamics. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Danger! Metaphors at Work in Economics, Geophysiology, and the Internet	2004	The author analyzes the types of metaphors that are used to describe the Internet in issues of Wired magazine from before and after the dot-com collapse to understand the perceptions and expectations of some of the actors involved in the shaping of the Internet. In addition, the metaphors deployed in economics and geophysiology are used to demonstrate how metaphors can influence public debate, policy, and theory. The author argues that metaphors do not simply have a descriptive function but that they also carry normative connotations. Language, alongside social practices and material objects, is an important tool in attempts to construct the future. Six overlapping metaphorical themes are identified: revolution, evolution, salvation, progress, universalism, and the "American dream." A critical analysis of these metaphors, informed by a critique of the metaphors used in economics and geophysiology, leads the author to challenge the universalist claims made by some Internet enthusiasts for the inclusive potential of the Internet.

Entropy production in an energy balance Daisyworld model	2008	Daisyworld is a simple mathematical model of a planetary system that exhibits self-regulation due to the nature of feedback between life and its environment. A two-box Daisyworld is developed that shares a number of features with energy balance climate models. Such climate models have been used to explore the hypothesis that non-equilibrium, dissipative systems such as planetary atmospheres are in a state of maximum entropy production with respect to the latitudinal flux of heat. When values for heat diffusion in the two-box Daisyworld are selected in order to maximize this rate of entropy production, the viability range of the daisies is maximized. Consequently planetary temperature is regulated over the widest possible range of solar forcing.

Limbs of life: Literature of postmodern anthropomorphic technology and cosmology	2000	The postmodern's inevitable coexistence with machines changes humans into a machine-like processing entity while machines become more autonomous like humans. Especially focussing upon Artificial Intelligence, many postmodern writers deal with the newly emerging third space between human and nonhuman. This dissertation argues that as the cognitive base of human thoughts and languages, this paranormally blended space of quasi-objects (such as cyborgs) suggests the new insightful direction of paratactic postmodern culture, which in certain ways parallels with anthropomorphic mythologies.                 As the term "matrix" means "womb" in Greek, the metaverse in postmodern cyberpunk fiction is inherently related to creation myths. If "technology," as McLuhan says, "extends creative powers by amputating the natural ones," postmodern science fiction writers use anthropomorphic creation myths to reunite those dismembered limbs of the natural body, the human's instinctive transpersonal subconscious.                 Richard Powers's Helen and Neal Stephenson's avatars are mechanical anthropomorphic technologies (Mechs in McHale's terms) whose dilemmas are allegorically reflected in their parallels with the Gilgamesh and Galatea myths. Although homogeneity is seriously criticized through Pygmalion's incestuous relation with Galatea and Bob Rife's recovery of glossolalia via a computer virus, transcendental visions in mechanical anthropomorphic narratives are limited to a less satisfactory level. By contrast, Marge Piercy's Yod and Octavia Butler's Oankali, as the biological anthropomorphic hybrids ("biopunks" in McHale's terms) show the higher reality which is neither matter nor mind. Their parallel to creation myths, to the Gaia hypothesis and to Golem, like chaos theory, reveal that mind and matter are interdependent and correlated.                 While answering both "why" questions in science and "how" questions in literature, the entrapment and escapism (mostly in mechanical hybrids) as well as excitement and joy (mostly in machines of blood and flesh) of these anthropomorphic technologies are theoretically applied to some important topics in the postmodern literature of science such as the sublime, metamorphoses, information, chaos theory, allegory and linguistics. Finally, this dissertation examines the potential self-idolatry tendency in these "fractal" anthropomorphic hybrids where the finite is reflected as the small scale of the infinite. In the information-flowing society of masquerade, transcendental and sublime moments are rather safety illuminated by implosive personifications such as Octavia Butler's transcultural and persistent metaphor of the humble seed.

Advances in Marine Biology Volume 41	2001	This review assesses the degree to which phytoplankton in the contemporary oceans interact with the essential trace metals in their chemical environment as exemplified by the cycling of iron, manganese, cobalt, nickel and zinc. The toxic element cadmium is also considered because of the extent to which it is taken up. The stage is set by a brief consideration of the overall geochemical controls on the composition of sea water and their implications for the milieu within which life evolved. The utilization of the elements within the cells is addressed with the consequent implications for optimizing the uptake of essential elements and controlling the ingress of potentially toxic elements. The impact of the change from an anoxic to an oxygenated atmosphere some 2 billion years ago on the availability of the basic building blocks for living systems is considered. The essential elements have to be delivered to the centres of synthesis in the appropriate ratios. The optimal tailoring of the flows of material into and out of the cell to meet the requirements for maintenance, growth and reproduction requires a carefully regulated internal economy. This internal economy sets the guidelines for the interaction of phytoplankton with the chemistry of their aqueous environment. The uptake mechanisms are explored using data derived from culture experiments indicating a significant degree of biological influence on the chemistry of the essential elements close to the cell surface (the near-field chemistry). The perspective is then widened to consider the implications of these processes for the relative concentrations of the elements and their distribution throughout the world's oceans (the far-field chemistry). Case histories are followed for iron, manganese, copper, zinc, cobalt and nickel reviewing (a) their distribution in the oceans, (b) their biological availability, (c) their uptake and impact upon primary production. This external economy is intimately related to the feedback between the organisms and their environment. The extent of recycling within the ocean system by the mutually dependent processes of photosynthesis and respiration provides a clear measure of the regulatory power of the biological system itself. This is analysed in the context of the Gaia hypothesis. Although the biological processes, to a large degree, control the availability and distribution of the essential trace metals in the oceans, the system does not appear to be optimized. For example cadmium, generally considered to be a non-essential element, is recycled more vigorously than any other element. Zinc in contrast appears to be rendered less accessible as the result of biological activity, and phytoplankton cells in the open ocean are straining at the limit of diffusive transport to obtain sufficient supplies.

Desiccation resistance and contamination as mechanisms of gaia.	1985	The gaia hypothesis, formulated by J.E. Lovelock, asserts the composition of the reactive gases, the oxidation-reduction state and the temperature of the lower atmosphere of the planet Earth are actively regulated by the biota. Lovelock and Watson, using highly simplified mathematical models, have shown that the modulation of atmospheric temperature can be achieved by exponentially growing populations of differently colored organisms ("dark and light daisies"). It is more likely that the modulation of atmospheric gas composition is based on the colligative properties of exponentially growing mixed populations of microorganisms rather than on "daisies". Exponential growth of one population of microorganisms leads to gaseous and other metabolic products released to the environment, which favor the exponential growth of different populations, each with their own unique emissions. Extremely high densities of mixed populations of microorganisms ensue. These populations form structured microbial communities composed of members in varying states of activity. Growth potential of metabolically diverse populations most likely provides the basis for the responsiveness of the biota to changing environments. We have attempted to measure an aspect of the growth potential and diversity of one microbial community, that from a flat laminated microbial mat dominated by the cyanobacterium, Microcoleus. Microbial mat samples collected at yearly intervals between 1977 and 1982 were allowed to dry. Subsamples were revived under laboratory conditions by rewetting, and the resulting complex microbial populations were analyzed. Greater than 10(4) viable organisms per ml were estimated to be present in the desiccated samples. Only a portion of the diverse community could be characterized. There were at least 115 different types of desiccation resistant microorganisms present in these samples, primarily bacteria. However, more than a dozen types of rather uncommon fungi and protoctists were removed from naturally desiccated material. Several did not fit descriptions of previously known species or strains. Neither animals nor plants were recovered from these tiny samples. We present minimal diversity estimates for microorganisms in both the desiccated samples and the corresponding fresh laminated microbial mat community from which they were taken. We found that many organisms in laboratory samples capable of immediate growth from a desiccated state were not common components of growing mats in the field.

Geochemistry of natural waters - The legacy of V.I. Vernadsky and his students	2012	The geochemist, Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky has only recently become recognised internationally, despite being regarded as one of the greatest names in science of the 20th century in his homeland Russia. There are several reasons for his lack of renown in the west, but mainly because his most important work "The Biosphere" was only fully translated into English in 1997. This book and the ideas it contains are now becoming regarded as one of the pioneering works of the last century. It defines the biosphere as a unifying, holistic concept for the earth system at a time when reductionism was the driving motivation in scientific research. Above all, for earth scientists, Vernadsky regarded life as the driving geological force. However another, as yet unpublished work (in three volumes) entitled "The History of Natural Waters" also deserves similar attention. This book explores many concepts in hydrogeology, geochemistry, geofluid circulation and especially biology in which water is described as an integral part of the biosphere. Vernadsky's teachers, including Mendeleev, Butlerov and Dokuchaev had a special influence on his early career path. He published prolifically in the 1920s and 1930s as well as founding several key institutions in Russia and Eastern Europe. The influence of the Russian school of landscape geochemistry, led by Dokuchaev also had a great influence on Vernadsky's scientific work and productivity, as was a period of study in France in the 1920s. The History of Natural Waters covers the spectrum of hydrogeochemical phenomena, in rather a descriptive way, yet its influence as the foundation of later ideas on hydrochemical processes and water-rock interaction, as well as hydrogeology, can easily be recognised. As well as including the role of biology in hydrogeochemistry, this work clearly emphasises the role of mans' influence on changing the chemistry of natural waters. Vernadsky adopted the concept of the 'Noosphere' (the evolution of human thought) to emphasis man's role as a geological agent. His publications foreshadow Gaia theory some half a century later. Vernadsky's works thus made a huge contribution to the development of many science areas and have changed the scientific world view; moreover they have defined the position of mankind in the evolution of the Earth and the biosphere and also put urgent questions for future generations with significance at the present time. His ideas have not always been understood and even more so recognised. He always remembered the words of Alexander von Humboldt: "A hundred years are necessary to reach the truth and another hundred in order to start following it" © 2012.

POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF A CHANGE IN CLIMATE ON THE FORESTS OF    CENTRAL-EUROPE	1991	Changes of climate greatly affect soil management and    civilisation.  The one in the offing, in contrast to those of    the past, is set off by man himself.  The high speed of change    indicated here is especially problematic, because the speed of    vegetation adaptation can probably not keep up with it.  There    is fear that the homeostatic regulatory function of the    biosphere (Gaia-theory according to LOVELOCK) will be    overburdened. The processes in the offing can above all be    attributed to a considerable CO2-increase in the earth's    atmosphere.  Forest clearing in ancient times and during the    early Middle Ages, forest destruction at the present time, and    burning of fossile carbon are the cause for this carbon dioxide    increase. The temperature rise predicted by numerous    climatologists and the different meteorological effects    resulting from it may have considerable impact on various plant    species and plant communities.  This applies especially to    species and phytozoenoses which are already today found in    ecologically marginal spheres, and which will be pushed into    ecological nonexistence by the climate change. Using several    examples, transformations of tree-species ranges and    competitive conditions between tree species caused by climate    changes are illustrated in connection with some methodological    relevancies.  Various questions, e.g. the fertilizer effect of    CO2 and the physiological reaction of certain species to    warming, still require thorough investigation. Based on the    climate changes predicted by meteorologists the attempt is made    to derive some preliminary conclusions for forest management.    At first there should be a general orientation towards    ecologically sound silviculture, in this case based on variable    site conditions.  General recommendation is to shape a    resilient and stable forest i.e. one which is diverse in regard    to tree species, age, and spatial structure.  From this    viewpoint, suggestions are made on choice of tree species,    forest restoration, stand treatment, and forest protection.    Concluding and referring to numerous literature citations,    measures to reduce further CO2-emissions and to withdraw carbon    from the atmosphere are briefly discussed.  It is concluded    that preservation of forests, high carbon accumulation in the    forests, afforestations, and long-term bonding of carbon    through using wood for construction are valuable contributions    towards improving the earth's carbon balance.  This cardinal    question for mankind, however, can only be resolved through    drastic reduction of the burning of fossile fuels!	Forstwiss.

Geophysiology and parahistology of the interactions of organisms with the environment	1996	Ecology and Global Ecology (GE) are terms by which the relations between the organism (or living matter as a whole) and the environment (or Earth as a whole) have been treated for almost a century. Geophysiology and Parahistology (PH) are terms slowly replacing older scientific thoughts jointly with an increasing number of modifications and alterations of the Darwinian Evolution (DE) concept. Somehow Geophysiology and Parahistology seem to describe evolution in a non-Darwinian domain. According to V.I. VERNADSKY (1929, 1930, 1988) - the great Russian naturalist and biogeochemist - the biogeochemical processes on Earth are controlled by the force of living matter rather than by species associations developing in and with individual ecosystems as expressed by darwinian evolutionary terms. He also claimed that GOETHE was incorrectly regarded as a predecessor of DE by some authors (including DARWIN) and that "Natur" (nature) and "Lebendige Natur" (the totality of creatures) are two very different things for GOETHE. Detailed analyses of microbial mat systems in the German Wadden Sea and in artificial hypersaline WINOGRADSKY columns have shown that the totality of creatures and matter around them i.e., the "lebendige Natur" sensu GOETHE or "living matter" sensu VERNADSKY of such environments control to a considerable extent the structure, stability, and (geo-)morphology of sediments and thereby the geological structure of the living Earth. These structures do not follow the rules of sedimentation formulated by the laws of STOKES. They represent growth structures (Aufwuchs), whose physics and dynamics are controlled by complex fractal systems. The factors controlling the ultimate shape and stabilisation potential of the eventually resulting rocks and fossils are comparable to tissue development in macroorganisms. Also, certain microbial associations in the sub-recent and in the fossil record may be compared to metazoan tissues. Chemical gradients in the sedimentary column, regulated by the interplay of living matter and sluggish (slow-reactive to non-reactive) compounds, combine to create a pattern of porosity and structure of the resulting deposits that clearly indicates microbial influences and especially those of extracellular polymeric substances on the morphology and texture. The combined effects of microbiota or living matter on the sedimentary record are described as parahistology of sediments in analogy of the histology of tissue on a geological scale. This conceptual living tissue made up of microbially generated rocks and ore deposits cycled through metabolic processes and forced into tissue-like structures by microbial biofilms and mats may extend down to the upper mantle of Earth and far up into the stratosphere when Earth is regarded as a living entity over geological periods. We may have to conceive Earth as a living specimen, which is breathing at a frequency of thousands of years instead of the normal physiological breathing rate of man or an insect. Macroorganisms in all terrestrial systems represent the transport and logistic media, which, however, utterly depend on myriads of intra-, inter-, and extracellular microbial symbiotic partners. Geophysiology - as a new scientific view of life process controlled biogeomorphogenetic and biogeochemical cycles - is presented in the context of a life field theory suggested by KRUMBEIN (1983) and an evolutionary field theory suggested by CRAMER (1989). The latter theories are related to physiological thoughts of FRIEDRICH II. VON HOHENSTAUFEN and to the "microgeology" of C. G. EHRENBERG (EHRENBERG, 1854; KANTOROWICZ, 1992; MASSON, 1993). The factors controlling the preservation of organic material and biogenic structures in rocks are discussed on the background of "climate change" and "global change" theories. Geophysiology and parahistology are introduced as new terms in a time where environment-organism relationships are increasingly studied on a global scale including physiological time scales by far exceeding individual darwinian organismal life times.

Daisyworld in two dimensional small-world networks	2011	Daisyworld was initially proposed as an abstract model of the\nself-regulation of planetary ecosystems. The original one-point model\nhas also been extended to one- and two-dimensional worlds. The latter\nare especially interesting. in that they not only demonstrate the\nemergence of spatially-stabilised homeostasis but also emphasise\ndynamics of heterogeneity within a system, in which individual locations\nin the world experience booms and busts, yet the overall behaviour is\nstabilised as patches of white and black daisies migrate around the\nworld. We extend the model further, to small-world networks, more\nrealistic for social interaction and even for some forms of ecological\ninteraction using the Watts-Strogatz (WS) and Newman-Watts (NW) models.\nWe find that spatially-stabilised homeostasis is able to persist in\nsmall-world networks. In the WS model, as the rewiring probabilities\nincrease even far beyond normal small-world limits, there is only a\nsmall loss of effectiveness. However as the average number of\nconnections increases in the NW model, we see a gradual breakdown of\nheterogeneity in patch dynamics, leading to less interesting more\nhomogenised worlds.

Symbiotic physiology promotes homeostasis in Daisyworld	2011	A connection is hypothesized between the physiological consequences of mutualistic symbiosis and life's average long-term impact on certain highly biologically conserved environmental variables. This hypothesis is developed analytically and with a variant of the Daisyworld model. Biological homeostasis is frequently effective due to co-ordination between opposing physiological "rein" functions, which buffer an organism in response to an external (often environmental) perturbation. It is proposed that during evolutionary history the pooling of different species' physiological functions in mutualistic symbioses increased the range of suboptimal environmental conditions that could be buffered against-a mutual tolerance benefit sometimes sufficient to outweigh the cost of cooperation. A related argument is that for a small number of biologically-crucial physical variables (i) the difference between organism interiors and the life-environment interface is relatively low, and (ii) the biologically optimum level of that variable is relatively highly conserved across different species. For such variables, symbiosis tends to cause (at a cost) an increase in the number of environmental buffering functions per unit of selection, which in turn biases the overall impact of the biota on the state of the variable towards the biological optimum. When a costly but more temperature-tolerant and physiologically versatile symbiosis between one black (warming) and one white (cooling) "daisy" is added to the (otherwise unaltered) Daisyworld parable, four new results emerge: (1) The extension of habitability to a wider luminosity range, (2) resistance to the impact of "cheater" white daisies with cold optima, that derive short-term benefit from environmental destabilisation, (3) the capacity to maintain residual, oscillatory regulation in response to forcings that change more rapidly than allele frequencies and (crucially) (4) "succession"-type dynamics in which the tolerant symbiosis colonises and to an extent makes habitable an otherwise lifeless environment, but is later displaced by free-living genotypes that have higher local fitness once conditions improve. The final result is arguably analogous to lichen colonisation of the Neoproterozoic land surface, followed by the Phanerozoic rise of vascular plants. Caution is necessary in extrapolating from the Daisyworld parable to real ecology/geochemistry, but sufficiently conserved variables may be water potential, macronutrient stoichiometry and (to a lesser extent) the temperature window for metabolic activity. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The seasonal effect in one-dimensional Daisyworld	2012	We have studied the effects of seasonal Solar Radiation Forcing (SRF) on the climate self-regulatory capability of life, using a latitudinal-dependent Daisyworld model. Because the seasonal polarity of SRF increases poleward, habitable conditions exist in the equatorial regions year round, whereas, in the high latitudes, harsh winters cause annual extinction of life, and only the summers are inhabited or regulated by life. Seasonality affects climate regulation by two major mechanisms: (1) the cold winter conditions in the high latitudes reduce the global temperature below the optimal temperature; (2) during summer, life experiences higher SRF anomalies and, therefore, shifts to higher albedo when compared to annual mean SRF. In turn, a full capacity for temperature regulation is reached at lower SRF, and the range of SRF over which life regulates climate is significantly reduced. Lastly, initiation/extinction of life at low/highly-perturbed SRF occurs at the poles. Therefore, an irreversible global extinction occurs once life passes its regulatory capacity in the poles. We conduct extensive sensitivity analyses on various model parameters (latitudinal heat diffusion, heat capacity, and population death rate), strengthening the generality/robustness of the above net seasonal effects. Applications to other SRF fluctuation, as Milankovitch cycles are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Interspecific competition affects temperature stability in Daisyworld	2000	The model of Daisyworld showed that nonteleological mechanistic responses\nof life to the physical environment can stabilize an exogenously\nperturbed environment, in the model, 2 species of daisies, black\nand white, stabilize the global temperature of a planet exposed to\ndifferent levels of insolation. In both species, the response of\nthe growth rate to local temperature is identical, but differences\nin albedo between the 2 species generate differences in local temperatures.\nThe shifting balance between the daisies keeps the global temperature\nin a range suitable for life. Watson and Lovelock made the stronger\nclaim that ``the model always shows greater stability with daisies\nthan it does without them.'' We examined this claim by introducing\nan extra source of competition into the equations that describe the\ninteractions between the daisy species. Depending on the parameters\nof competition, temperatures can vary more widely with increasing\ninsolation in the presence of daisies than without them. It now seems\npossible, timely and perhaps necessary, to include an accurate representation\nof interspecific competition when taking account of vegetational\ninfluences on climate.

Evolution Without Natural Selection Furhter Implications of the Daisyworld Parable	1994	Daisyworld is a model dynamical system in which very simple mechanisms interact to produce complex behaviour. It was devised to show how regulation can arise without natural selection. Here we investigate the model in greater detail. We analyze the possible steady states and study the response of the system under different conditions, we consider the implications of the hysteresis which is found in this and many other non-linear systems, and we compare the properties of the model with those of systems that evolved solely by natural selection. Natural selection inherently concentrates on local optimization and immediate advantage rather than on robustness and long term benefit. This makes some features of organisms hard to explain within the synthetic theory. The model suggests that the solution may simply be that natural selection was not the crucial factor in their evolution. When a system that has previously responded to challenge counter- intuitively or apparently not at all subsequently begins to react in the way one would expect, this should be taken as a warning that it is a regulated system and that the regulation may be about to break down. If that happens, there is likely to be a catastrophic change as the system either collapses altogether or else moves rapidly to the state it would have been in without regulation. Recovery, if possible at all, is likely to be unexpectedly difficult.

Daisyworld revisited: Quantifying biological effects on planetary self-regulation	2001	Daisyworld demonstrates that self-regulation of the global environment can emerge from organisms altering their local environment in different ways. In Daisyworld, natural selection is directly linked to environmental effects such that what is selected for at the individual level is beneficial to the global environment. The model has been modified and extended in many studies that have highlighted the effect of biological processes on system self-regulation. Here we better quantify their effects and present new variants of the model in an attempt to resolve outstanding debates. The results confirm that Daisyworld is a remarkably robust self-regulating system and they offer some general lessons about systems where life has a strong effect on the environment, which we think are relevant to the Earth. As forcing becomes extreme, such systems can exhibit co-existing stable states with and without life (bi-stability), and rapid transitions from one to the other that are difficult to reverse. The growth response of organisms to the environment has a role in determining the range of forcing over which a system can regulate. Density-dependent ecological interactions improve Daisyworld’s regulatory properties, although increased inter-species competition destabilises the environment in one interval. Selfregulation is little affected by introducing organisms that ‘‘cheat’’ by not altering their local environment and in so doing gain a growth advantage. Increased variation in an environmentaltering trait (albedo) can weaken the negative feedback it provides on the environment. However, random mutation of this trait and subsequent natural selection can generate and extend the range of temperature regulation and improve the system’s response to perturbation with time. Internal adaptation of organisms toward prevailing environmental conditions, or to tolerate extremes, can also extend the range of forcing over which life persists.

One-dimensional daisyworld: Spatial interactions and pattern formation	2003	The zero-dimensional daisyworld model of Watson and Lovelock (1983) demonstrates that life can unconsciously regulate a global environment. Here that model is extended to one dimension, incorporating a distribution of incoming solar radiation and diffusion of heat consistent with a spherical planet. Global regulatory properties of the original model are retained. The daisy populations are initially restricted to hospitable regions of the surface but exert both global and local feedback to increase this habitable area, eventually colonizing the whole surface. The introduction of heat diffusion destabilizes the coexistence equilibrium of the two daisy types. In response, a striped pattern consisting of blocks of all black or all white daisies emerges. There are two mechanisms behind this pattern formation. Both are connected to the stability of the system and an overview of the mathematics involved is presented. Numerical experiments show that this pattern is globally determined. Perturbations in one region have an impact over the whole surface but the regulatory properties of the system are not compromised by transient perturbations. The relevance of these results to the Earth and the wider climate modelling field is discussed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spatio-temporal dynamics and quantification of daisyworld in two-dimensional coupled map lattices	2012	We spatially extend the daisyworld model on a two-dimensional toroidal coupled map lattice (CML - a generalisation of cellular automata). We investigated whether this tightly coupled system of local nonlinear dynamics with bi-directional life-environment feedback can generate a specific kind of behaviour, characterised by global stability coexisting with local instability. We introduce appropriate metrics to measure the spatio-temporal dynamics of the daisyworld system. Specifically, we evaluate spatial autocorrelation using Moran's I, and local and global temporal fluctuation through the permutation entropy and the temporal standard deviation. We categorise a range of different behaviours that can arise in such scenarios, and relate them through a parameter analysis. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Mutation of albedo and growth response produces oscillations in a spatial Daisyworld	2006	We extended a two-dimensional cellular automaton (CA) Daisyworld to include mutation of optimal growth temperature as well as mutation of albedo. Thus, the organisms (daisies) can adapt to prevailing environmental conditions or evolve to alter their environment. We find the resulting system oscillates with a period of hundreds of daisy generations. Weaker and less regular oscillations exist in previous daisyworld models, but they become much stronger and more regular here with mutation in the growth response. Despite the existence of a particular combination of mean albedo and optimum individual growth temperature which maximises growth, we find that this global state is unstable with respect to mutations which lower absolute growth rate, but increase marginal growth rate. The resulting system oscillates with a period that is found to decrease with increasing death rate, and to increase with increasing heat diffusion and heat capacity. We speculate that the origin of this oscillation is a Hopf bifurcation, previously predicted in a zero-dimensional system. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Daisyworld is Darwinian: constraints on adaptation are important for planetary self-regulation.	2000	The Daisyworld model demonstrates that self-regulation of the global environment can emerge from competition amongst types of life altering their local environment in different ways. Robertson & Robinson (1998. J. theor. Biol.195, 129-134) presented what they describe as a "Darwinian Daisyworld" in which the ability of organisms to adapt their internal physiology in response to environmental change undermines their ability to regulate their environment. They assume that there are no bounds on the environmental conditions that organisms can adapt to and that equal growth rates can potentially be achieved under any conditions. If adaptation could respond sufficiently rapidly to changes in the environment, this would eliminate any need for the environment to be regulated in the first place, because all possible states of the environment would be equally tolerable to life. However, the thermodynamics, chemistry and structure of living organisms set bounds on the range of environmental conditions that can be adapted to. As these bounds are approached, environmental conditions limit growth rate, and adaptations necessary for survival can also cost energy. Here we take account of such constraints and find that environmental regulation is recovered in the Daisyworld model. Hence, we suggest that constraints are an important part of a self-regulating planetary system.

Biological homeostasis of the global environment: the parable of Daisyworld	1983	The biota have effected profound changes on the environment of the surface of the earth. At the same time, that environment has imposed constraints on the biota, so that life and the environment may be considered as two parts of a coupled system. Unfortunately, the system is too complex and too little known for us to model it adequately. To investigate the properties which this close-coupling might confer on the system, we chose to develop a model of an imaginary planet having a very simple biosphere. It consisted of just two species of daisy of different colours and was first described by Lovelock (1982). The growth rate of the daisies depends on only one environmental variable, temperature, which the daisies in turn modify because they absorb different amounts of radiation. Regardless of the details of the interaction, the effect of the daisies is to stabilize the temperature. The result arises because of the peaked shape of the growth-temperature curve and is independent of the mechanics by which the biota are assumed to modify the temperature. We sketch out the elements of a biological feedback system which might help regulate the temperature of the earth.

Role of a simplified hydrological cycle and clouds in regulating the climate - Biota system of Daisyworld	2009	The role of a simplified hydrological cycle and a physical representation of clouds is investigated in the Daisyworld model, subject to constant and variable solar forcing and varying cloud albedo and height. Under constant forcing, properties of the cloudy hydrologic cycle control the long-term system dynamics to non-oscillatory, oscillatory, abiotic or biotic states. In case of oscillatory solutions, their amplitude and periodicity are controlled by the net cooling or warming effects from clouds. Two conditions are considered under variable forcing—active or neutral—depending on the existence or not of biota–environment feedbacks. Temperature, cloudiness and hydrological variables are self-regulated in the active condition, whereas non-regulated in the neutral condition. Self-regulation is quantified through two measurements (luminosity range and total life), both of which can be larger in our model than in several other variants of Daisyworld, depending on cloud characteristics. The hydrological cycle and clouds can make the planet more habitable for life, independent of the capacity of the system for biological adaptation. Two hypotheses are put forward: (1) beneficial effects for life emerge from biota–clouds interactions, enhancing the global amount of life and extending the life span; and (ii) the existence of a maximum self-regulation capacity principle.

Hysteresis and the limits of homeostasis: From daisyworld to phototaxis	2005	All biological organisms must be able to regulate certain essential internal variables, e.g. core body temperature in mammals, in order to survive. Almost by definition, those that cannot are dead. Changes that result in a mammal being able to tolerate a wider range of core body temperatures make that organism more robust to external perturbations. In this paper we show that when internal variables are regulated via `rein control¿ mechanisms, decreasing the range of tolerable values increases the area of observed hysteresis but does not decrease the limits of regulation. We present circumstances where increasing the range of tolerable values actually decreases robustness to external perturbation.

Evolutionary Daisyworld models: A new approach to studying complex adaptive systems	2010	This paper presents a model of a population of error-prone self-replicative species (replicators) that interact with its environment. The population evolves by natural selection in an environment whose change is caused by the evolutionary process itself. For simplicity, the environment is described by a single scalar factor, i.e. its temperature. The formal formulation of the model extends two basic models of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, namely, Daisyworld and Quasispecies models. It is also assumed that the environment can also change due to external perturbations that are summed up as an external noise. Unlike previous models, the population size self-regulates, so no ad hoc population constraints are involved. When species replication is error-free, i.e. without mutation, the system dynamics can be described by an (n+. 1)-dimensional system of differential equations, one for each of the species initially present in the system, and another for the evolution of the environment temperature. Analytical results can be obtained straightforwardly in low-dimensional cases. In these examples, we show the stabilizing effect of thermal white noise on the system behavior. The error-prone self-replication, i.e. with mutation, is studied computationally. We assume that species can mutate two independent parameters: its optimal growth temperature and its influence on the environment temperature. For different mutation rates the system exhibits a large variety of behaviors. In particular, we show that a quasispecies distribution with an internal sub-distribution appears, facilitating species adaptation to new environments. Finally, this ecologically inspired evolutionary model is applied to study the origin and evolution of public opinion. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Glucose homeostasis with infinite gain: Further lessons from the Daisyworld parable?	1997	A major unresolved physiological problem is how the rate of hepatic glucose production is increased to match the increased rate of glucose utilization during exercise without a change in arterial blood glucose level. A homeostat with such capabilities is said to have infinite gain. Daisyworld is an imaginary planet orbiting a variable star. The only life is black and white daisies. Black daisies retain heat, slightly warming the planet; white daisies cool it. When the two types of daisies grow best at slightly different temperatures, variations in solar luminosity (over a wide range) cause the ratio of white:black daisies to vary in a manner that keeps the planetary temperature constant. This model therefore achieves infinite gain by having two opposing but interdependent controllers. Here we suggest that the pancreatic islet alpha- and beta-cells might act as black and white daisies. For the analogy to apply, glucagon and insulin must not only have opposing effects on the blood sugar concentration, but the secretion of the one has, at some quantum level, to be at the expense of the other. Electrical coupling between heterocellular groups of alpha- and beta-cells within the pancreatic islets suggests that this might indeed be the case. alpha-Cell activity must, furthermore, promote secretory activity in other alpha-cells; similarly with beta-cells. This is probably mediated via pancreastatin and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) which are paracrinically co-secreted with glucagon and insulin, respectively. alpha-Cell activity spreads (at the expense of beta-cell activity) when the blood glucose level is below set point, while beta-cell activity progressively replaces alpha-cell activity above set point. At set point changes in the ratio of alpha:beta-cell activity are inhibited.

Emergent patterns in space and time from daisyworld: a simple evolving coupled biosphere-climate model.	2010	We present a simplified model of a coupled planetary geosphere-biosphere, with two evolving species coupled through a single enviromental variable. The species do not compete directly, but instead compete through, and can evolve their effect on, this environmental parameter. The model produces an evolutionary arms race, with each species evolving extreme behaviour to counteract the other. The result is an apparently stable balance, with the planet supporting a maximum amount of life, in unusually patterned configurations. However, this balance is achieved by two countering effects and is susceptible to very large correlated fluctuations and extinction events if the balance is disturbed. This arms-race evolution is observed even for very small differences between the species: for a coupled evolving system, the 'neutral' theory of identical species is not the limiting case.

"Wet/dry Daisyworld": A conceptual tool for quantifying the spatial scaling of heterogeneous landscapes and its impact on the subgrid variability of energy fluxes	2005	We modified the "Daisyworld" model of Watson and Lovelock to consider the energy balance of vegetation with differing potential to evaporate water vapour across a 2-D landscape. High-resolution spatial fields of surface temperature, latent heat exchange and net radiation are computed using cellular automata (CA). The CA algorithm considers competition between actively transpiring "wet daisies" and "dry daisies" for bare ground through temperature-dependent birth and death probabilities. This paper examines how differences in biophysical properties (e.g. surface albedo and surface conductance) affect the composition and heterogeneity of the landscape and its energy exchange. And with high resolution and gridded spatial information we evaluate bias errors and scaling rules associated with the subgrid averaging of the nonlinear functions used to compute surface energy balance. Among our key findings we observe that there are critical conditions, associated with albedo and surface resistance, when wet or dry/dark or bright "daisies" dominate the landscape. Second, we find that the heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of "daisies" depends on initial conditions (e.g. a bare field versus a random assemblage of surface classes). And third, the spatial coefficient of variation of land class, latent heat exchange, net radiation and surface temperature scale with the exponential power of the size of the averaging window. Though conceptual in nature, the 2-D "wet/dry Daisyworld" model produces a virtual landscape whose power-law scaling exponent resembles the one derived for the spatial scaling of a normalized difference vegetation index for a heterogeneous savanna ecosystem. This observation is conditional and occurs if the initial landscape is bare with two small colonies of "wet" and "dry" daisies. Bias errors associated with the nonlinear averaging of the surface energy balance equation increase as the coefficient of variation of the surface properties increases. Ignoring the subgrid variability of latent heat exchange produces especially large bias errors (up to 300%) for heterogeneous landscapes. We also find that spatial variations in latent heat exchange, surface temperature and net radiation, derived from our "Daisyworld" model, scale with the spatial variation in surface properties. These results suggest that we may be able to infer spatial patterns of surface energy fluxes from remote sensing data of surface features. "Wet/dry Daisyworld", therefore, has the potential to provide a link between observations of landscape heterogeneity, deduced from satellites, and their interpretation into spatial fields of latent and sensible heat exchange and surface temperature.

Daisyworld inhabited with daisies incorporating a seed size/number trade-off: The mechanism of negative feedback on selection from a standpoint of the competition theory	2005	We reexamined a Daisyworld model from the traditional view of competition theory. Unlike the original model, white and black daisies in our model incorporate a seeding/germination trade-off against bare ground area without assuming the local temperature reward. As a result, the planetary temperature is automatically regulated by two species if the following conditions are met: (i) the species react equally to an environmental condition, but one can alter the environmental condition in the opposite direction to the other. (ii) that one of the two cannot have both a higher maximal growth rate (??max) and lower half-saturation constant (K) than those of the other. In other words, a pair of phenotypes incorporates a trade-off between quality and number of seeds. We found that the homeostatic regulation can also be reconciled with the adaptive evolution of optimal temperature. The results of simulation imply that biotic environmental feedback can also be maintained when the emergence of polymorphisms (black and white daisies) is closely linked to such a trade-off. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The Green Cathedral: An Interview with the Rev. James Parks Morton	1990	The Green Cathedral  The Dean of New York's Cathedral of St. John the Divine  remains at the cutting edge of ecology & spirituality  An Interview with the Rev. James Parks Morton, by Alan AtKisson One of the articles in Earth & Spirit (IC#24) Late Winter 1990, Page 16 Copyright (c)1990, 1997 by Context Institute | To order this issue ...   The Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine, located in New York City's upper west side near Harlem, is the second largest gothic cathedral in world - and a lot more than that. Under its visionary Dean, James Parks Morton, the Cathedral has become the heart of a thriving community of cultural "evolutionaries" of many different types - from musicians like Paul Winter to thinkers like William Irwin Thompson. Besides being a leader in ecological issues in the city (and the world), the Cathedral is also the site of many social programs, such as an apprenticeship program that helps unemployed minority youth from surrounding ghetto areas become skilled stonecutters and artisans.  In this interview, Dean Morton tells some of the story of his own evolution, and describes some of the challenges facing all religious institutions. For more information about the Cathedral's innovative programs, write to its public information office at 1047 Amsterdam Ave., New York, NY 10025.   Alan: For some years now you've been affectionately known as "The Green Dean." Were you always interested in ecology?  Dean Morton: Well, the short answer is no. The focus of my ministry was always around issues of poverty and social justice, particularly urban poverty, in the tradition of the French worker-priests. My involvement with issues of the environment and ecology is comparatively recent. Earlier on - when I was working in the poor dock areas of Jersey City, or setting up ecumenical training programs for religious professionals in inner city Chicago - I didn't even know the word "ecology."  Alan: What brought it to your attention?  Dean Morton: As soon as I became Dean of the Cathedral 1972, I got to know a group of people gravitating around the work of William Irwin Thompson. Bill asked me to come onto the board of the Lindisfarne Association, and that really was my introduction to "planetary thinking," as he called it. I also met Gregory Bateson, John and Nancy Todd, and others in those early years, and then a very major shift for me was meeting René Dubos, who wrote Beast or Angel? Choices That Make Us Human, in 1975. He was the one who really turned me upside down.  I also met Thomas Berry that same year, so in that period of the early 1970s, my mind got very changed in terms of understanding how one describes the universe. I went through some very serious reconceptualizing of man's relation to the Earth as it had been spelled out in the Judeo-Christian traditions.  In Lindisfarne we were all slugging through questions like, how does science function? How do art and literature function? How does religion function? How do all of these disciplines and ways of ordering knowledge and action function in a context that is now planetary? My task has been trying to put flesh on that reconceptualization - to speak it, but also to act it out, to make it living and palpable, to make it experienced in what goes on in the cathedral.  A cathedral, by definition, is a sort of microcosm, as the great holy places of the world always are. A Parthenon, a mosque, a cathedral or whatever, by its scale and focus and what is involved in building it, is a center of thought, the arts, commerce - the whole community. Great temples and holy places always play that role; they're related to everything that goes on in the society. The understanding of man's place in the cosmos is always summarized and carried to its highest expression in a holy place, in a holy building. The French term René Dubos always used was haut lieu - a high place, whether it's the mountain itself, or a temple on the mountain.  Obviously, then, the lexicon of the cathedral - its language and metaphors - had to be in sync with the most profound current understanding of the world, and where people fit in that world.   Alan: Wasn't your cathedral a lone pioneer in reflecting that kind of ecological, or planetary, understanding?  Dean Morton: Well, that's been fascinating. Ninety-nine percent of the people within the religious community and their leadership - and you can name the tradition - were simply not thinking that way. Ecological insights, new paradigms and the like were another language. When we would talk to our fellow religious types about these things, they would say, "What are you doing?" That's not where the cutting edge was in terms of most of the religious institutions. Social action, social justice, peace issues - that was where the most advanced thought was.   Alan: How did these new ways of thinking begin to find expression in the cathedral?  Dean Morton: In the 1970s I had Dubos, Thompson, the Todds, Amory and Hunter Lovins, Thomas Berry and others - they were really a small group of colleagues working on the same issues - all preaching here at the cathedral. I was also trying to do some restructuring with the given seasons of the church. Lent, for example, is very much about penitence and suffering. I would say, "Let's talk about the suffering of the Earth, the passion of water. Let's talk about Jesus in Earth - God incarnate in the flesh of Earth, the flesh of water, the flesh of the elements of creation and how that creation is suffering - the passion of the creation." And that was very effective.  Then in 1979 we had the first Sun Day Celebration with speakers like Margaret Mead, Robert Redford, and Gus Speth, and thousands of people came. Again, that's something a cathedral can do - have a big celebration. The issue is lifted up, and it's sung and danced and spoken. That same year we also had a big fair on behalf of all the environmental groups in New York, and this is how New York started getting the message with respect to the cathedral's activism in these issues.  Also in 1979, it was our turn to host the annual four-day meeting of all of the cathedral deans of North and South America, as well as half a dozen English deans who came too. And guess who spoke? Tom Berry, René Dubos, the Todds - we were kind of a traveling show.   Alan: So 1979 was really a watershed year.  Dean Morton: Yes. That was also the year that James Lovelock's book Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth was published by Oxford Press. We had the book party here at the cathedral, and his first public exposition of the Gaia Hypothesis was from our pulpit. He was the first in a series of ten preachers, then came the "traveling show," and I ended the series with a sermon called "Earth as God's Body," which was my opportunity to reconstruct theology using St. Paul's categories of Corpus Christi, the body of Christ. For Paul, the whole creation becomes the body of Christ. Doing that was a lot of fun, and it had very high visibility. Still, to most people in religious circles, we were just odd.  Alan: But now there seems to be an awakening to these issues in the world of the church and the other faith communities.  Dean Morton: I think the awakening is very recent, and I don't think it's very deep. At the gathering in Assisi in 1986 hosted by WWF International there were some significant leaders there from faith communities around the world - but it was in no sense a mass movement. Some of the establishment was touched, but the establishment by no means bought it. Within the Episcopal Church, for example, we wanted to create ecological ministries as priority ministries for the church. But it didn't fly, even though the presiding bishop himself was behind it. He's the top voice and he sang the song - but if the rank and file, the political processes of the church don't catch on to the melody ...  Alan: Then it doesn't happen.  Dean Morton: Right. I think the churches are now scrambling to catch on, but it's really thanks to Time and Newsweek. But even the media didn't catch on for a long time! It took the disaster of two summers ago, the drought and the syringes washing up on the beaches of New York, for them to discover ozone depletion, the greenhouse effect - all of the stuff that's been on page 37 of the newspapers for the last ten years.  Alan: How can this awareness get firmly implanted into the mainstream of the faith communities?   Dean Morton: One way is to get these ideas into the language. The language of the "Sacred Earth" has got to become mainline. In many ways science is ahead of us in dealing with the mystery of the creation. You see, once we see ourselves as stardust, and the creation itself as stardust, then we can understand that we're all together in this reality. Berry sees us as the cosmos becoming consciousness. But we're not just disincarnate consciousness - we're conscious of the creation. And of the Creator. With that major conceptual shift come linguistic as well as liturgical shifts.  Alan: There seems to be a bursting forth of creativity now in creating liturgy and ritual. What's fueling that?  Dean Morton: The old sacred/secular dichotomy is breaking down. Part of the ecological understanding is that nothing can be excluded. It's all there. And if it's all there, then you celebrate the totality, as opposed to something that is over against something else. Contrast - this versus that - is one modality of expression. Both/and is another, diversity inside of unity is yet another. These are concepts that you then create liturgy with. The stuff that you're able to use to express your theological position will vary with the number of colors you've got on your theological palette. And here we've got a much richer palette, so more things get looked upon as sacred and worth celebrating. This is distinct from a kind of fortress mentality, where one sees a lot of stuff "out there" that we sacred people are escaping from - you know, "We're clean and they'	In Context	None	http://www.mendeley.com/research/green-cathedral-interview-rev-james-parks-morton
The green cathedral: Ecological spirituality practiced at the Episcopal Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine	1993	The green cathedral: Ecological spirituality practiced at the Episcopal Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine Amicus Journal, v 14 #4, Winter, 1993, p 22-28    COPYRIGHT Natural Resources Defense Council 1993   Poised between the cosmos and Harlem, with roots in New York granite and its towers reaching toward heaven, the Episcopal Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine has become a spiritual bridge linking past and present, sacred and secular, human beings and the rest of creation. The largest gothic church in the world, the cathedral, located on Morningside Heights on Manhattan's Upper West Side, looks over New York City physically and spiritually somewhat as its Medieval forbears tower over the cities of Europe. How well the church shepherds its flock today, in a place known for its homelessness, crime, and material poverty, may be a matter of debate. But few will doubt, as it begins to celebrate its second centennial, that it is a presence in its Harlem neighborhood and beyond, a place of excitement and experiment.   First built in 1893 in a Medieval style, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine has re-cultivated its traditional roots both architecturally and philosophically. Its ecological philosophy challenges some of the generally accepted tenets of the Christian faith as it has been practiced since the Reformation. Rejecting the belief that "man" is the center of the cosmos, the new "ecotheology" takes a biocentric view (held by many scientists but fewer clerics) that the human species is only one of millions of species, only one component of a self-regulating biosphere whose balance can be radically changed by the collapse of any one of its interdependent biological systems. That a powerful Episcopal church (by definition the seat of a bishop in the Anglican Church, one of the largest religious denominations in the world) should espouse such beliefs has far-reaching implications. In recent years, the church has gained new influence among the leaders of the major religious denominations with its Joint Appeal on Religion and Science, sponsored by leading theologians and popular scientists like Carl Sagan and Paul Ehrlich. "They have made a real break-through in reaching the top leadership of the major religions," says Bill Logan, editor of the cathedral's newsletter. "People who used to call him ~Sagan the Pagan' are now sitting down with him in meetings."   Not content with its gothic stone gargoyles, this church nurtures real creatures in its nave: a blue crab, striped bass, mussels, and other animals and plants from New York City's estuaries, meadows, parks, and wetlands, living in a specially constructed Earth Shrine habitat viewed by more than 750,000 visitors each year. Framed by the cathedral's immense columns and spanning twenty-five feet from floor to one of the gothic arches will be a wall of tropical rain forest flora composed of a thousand bromeliads, orchids, ferns, mosses, and aquatic plants created by designer Gerry Katzban; this tapestry of bio-diversity is one of many examples of "sacred ecology" expressive of the cathedral's special vision and works in progress.   What is a blue crab doing in the nave of a church? We ask the Very Reverend James Parks Morton, Dean of the Cathedral. "It is a symbol of ecotheology," he replies, peering through his spectacles over a desk crammed with myriad rocks, seashells, a bronze head of Buddha, five miniature globes of the earth seen from the moon, a twelve-branched Tiffany lamp, a hand-carved wooden cross from Mexico, a Nigerian goldweight, and a menagerie of toy animals, including at least eight serpents, one of which seems to be a green dragon because she has wings. Personal mementos and gifts from friends worldwide, they are, like the living crab, objects of creation, connected parts of the cosmos.   Ecology and religion, the Dean explains, bind the cosmos from below and above.  "Together, they are the heaven and the earth of the understanding we urgently need in this new millennium." The concept of an ecotheology came to him in 1972, soon after he was appointed to St. John the Divine by his mentor Bishop Paul Moore, Jr., with whom he had served as a worker-priest in the docklands of Jersey City. "At the time my ideas were fixed in the religious traditions of helping the poor and working as an activist for social justice. I was totally unprepared for the radical way our understanding of the world was being changed by quantum physics, by scientists and planetary thinkers with whom I came into contact - Rene Dubos, William Irwin Thompson, Gregory Bateson, Lynn Margulis, James Lovelock, and John and Nancy Todd. The real work of theology was being done by people such as these, not with prayer books but with microscopes, computers, and satellite imaging. But when I said this to my religious colleagues I was called heretic."   Few clerics then shared the idea of an ecotheology, Morton says, singling out his friend Thomas Berry, a Roman Catholic priest who was "sat upon by his own religious order." Morton shares Berry's belief that an ecological interpretation of the cosmos requires a corresponding re-interpretation of the story of creation. "The new scientific evidence about the origins of life made me realize that we could no longer deal with the human story as something apart from the life story, or the earth story, or the universe story," says Morton.   In the mid 1970's, when Morton, with the support of Bishop Moore, opened the cathedral to this new kind of religious understanding, the response from the Episcopal leadership - and indeed from all other denominations - was generally cool and sometimes downright hostile. From the Roman Catholic hierarchy came opposition, particularly to the idea of biocentricity, a position it still holds. As recently as Earth Day 1990. Archibishop John Cardinal O'Connor of New York admonished us to remember that these celebrations were not about "snails and whales," but about mankind.   A more muted type of resistance was that of clergy and lay people who were simply reluctant to change their old ways. "When we first heard about the changes at St John the Divine," said an Anglican minister from Pennsylvania on promise of anonymity, "we dismissed them as New Age gimmicks whose novelty would soon wear thin. But we are now beginning to see that Morton was a pioneer with the courage to challenge orthodoxy that was largely outdated."   Others expressed concern about "stranger goings-on" at St. John the Divine. Even the blessing of the animals was characterized as paganism, perhaps because it was so popular. Morton's response is that such critics were showing their ignorance, he says, "because this is the profoundest kind of religious experience we can have. And, furthermore, St. Francis is a strong star in the tradition of ecotheology in which he sees all of creation, not just human, as sacred."   For Morton the lessons of ecology are all-encompassing. "Ecology means the joining together of all the parts. The word environment takes in all of life at once. We cannot think of who we are and what life means unless we conceive answers at that scale." Thus theology and ecology, nature and human nature can no longer by divorced. In this new way of thinking, creation and communication are the two fundamental facts of the universe. "Every created thing is joined into the whole through the compassion of God, just as every sinuous joint of the rose window is connected through the Christ at its center," he says with a wave of his hand toward the west facade of the cathedral on Amsterdam Avenue.   The 180-degree shift from Anglican tradition in the Dean's own thinking sparked an almost immediate series of changes in the cathedral's rituals, ceremonies, and programs that began in 1972 and that are still having an effect two decades later.  While keeping the traditional Episcopal liturgy at its core, the church organized (and orchestrated) interfaith events, drawing upon Jewish creedal prayers, Buddhist meditations, African chants, and other non-Christian traditions. At Morton's urging, the altar was moved to the middle of the congregation so that people could gather around it in a circle for closer communication. Soon speaking from the pulpit and addressing a range of issues unusual for any church at that time were scientists and planetary thinkers he had be-friended, along with rabbis, immans, Mother Teresa and the Dalai Lama, Native Americans, artists, and politicians as well as homeless men and women and teenage mothers. "It became a whole new scene," a longtime member of the congregation recalls. "I found it innovative and exciting." Some churchgoers have been less complimentary. "Frankly it made my hackles rise," commented one middle-aged upper west-sider. "I don't think a church needs to be trendy or entertaining, so I moved to one that conducts its services in the way I remember as a child."   Hearkening back to Medieval practice, Morton sought to bring the church closer to its own community by enlisting young people from the neighborhood to be trained by English master craftsmen as stone cutters and carvers to resume construction of the unfinished third of the building. In 1981 the Cathedral marked the 800th anniversary of the birth of St. Francis with a specially commissioned performance of the "Missa Gloria/ Earth Mass." Four years later the congregation witnessed the blessing of the animals on the feast of St. Francis. Now an annual occasion occurring on the first Sunday in October, this is an all-day affair welcoming (among other creatures) elephant, llama, camel, a python so large that it must be carried by two people, birds, even algae, and thousands of humans with pets, all to be blessed at the altar and, after the service, an environmental fair.

Pushing up the daisies	2002	When components of an interacting dynamical system (such as organs within an organism, or daisies within the Daisyworld model) have a limited range of viability to changes in some essential variable, intuition suggests that increasing any individual range of viability will also increase viability in the context of the whole system. We show circumstances in which the reverse is true.

Exploiter-mediated coexistence and frequency-dependent selection in a numerical model of biodiversity.	1996	The key feature of the Daisyworld approach is to explicitly model feedbacks between the competitive dynamics of a planetary biota (daisies with different albedos) and the planet's climate, namely its surface temperature. Self-regulation of surface temperature and stable population dynamics are striking emergent properties of this system, despite increasing energy output from the model's sun. In this paper we attempt to perturb Daisyworld by introducing herbivores endowed with one of four strategies for feeding on daisies in a system rich in daisy diversity, and find that the herbivores only moderately diminish the temperature regulating abilities of the system. Furthermore, we find that the precise trajectory of the system's temperature regulation depends critically on which daisy species the herbivore allows to co-exist, thereby revealing that climate and patterns of biodiversity are highly interrelated in this model, and, possibly, in the real world.

The importance of timescales for the emergence of environmental self-regulation	2012	Models which explore the possibilities of emergent self-regulation in the Earth system often assume the timescales associated with changes in various sub-systems to be predetermined. Given their importance in guiding the fixed point dynamics of such models, relatively little formalism has been established. We analyse a classic model of environmental self-regulation, Daisyworld, and interpret the original equations for model temperature, changes in insolation, and self-organisation of the biota as an important separation of timescales. This allows a simple analytical solution where the model is reduced to two states while retaining important characteristics of the original model. We explore the consequences of relaxing some key assumptions. We show that increasing the rate of change of insolation relative to adaptation of the biota shows a sharp transition between regulating, and lifeless states. Additionally, in slowing the rate of model temperature change relative to the adapting biota we derive expressions for the damping rate of fluctuations, along with a threshold beyond which damped oscillations occur. We relax the assumption that seeding occurs globally by extending this analysis to solve a two-dimensional cellular automata Daisyworld. We conclude by reviewing a number of previous Daisyworld models and make explicit their respective timescales, and how their behaviour can be understood in light of our analysis. ?? 2012.

Evolution and the regulation of environmental variables	2005	The idea that the biota can regulate the abiotic components of their environment to levels suitable for life has attracted criticism from neo-Darwinian theorists but is still a viable hypothesis. Here we present a model, similar to Daisyworld [1] but more general, which allows for a more extensive study of the compatibility of biotic regulation with evolutionary theory. Results obtained highlight the importance of constraints on the evolutionary process for the emergence of regulation, and set the scene for more comprehensive future study.

A numerical-model for biodiversity	1992	A numerical model is presented based on Alfred Lotka's notion that the mathematics of evolutionary models would be simpler, not more complex, if the evolution of the organisms and of their physical environment was considered as a single process. The model is concerned with the climate and the community ecology of an imaginary planet, Daisyworld, in orbit around a star like the Sun. The stabilizing influence of environmental feedback is used to enable experiments in community ecology that might otherwise be impossible. The model planetary ecosystem is populated with numerous types of organism distributed in up to three trophic levels. There follows a preliminary report of an exploration of this model planet and an account of its biodiversity and species richness.

Tutorial modelling of geosphere-biosphere interactions: the effect of percolation-type habitat fragmentation	1999	A considerably extended two-dimensional version of the famous Lovelock-Watson model for geosphere-biosphere interactions ('Daisyworld') is employed to investigate the impact of habitat fragmentation. The latter is dynamically modelled through the standard percolation process first introduced by solid state theory. It is found that the connectivity of the space accessible for life, is crucial for ecological performance. In particular, the self-stabilizing capacity of the biosphere strongly depends on the fragmentation topology. An extremely rich and partially counter-intuitive eco-dynamics is observed when a simple community structure, consisting of plants and herbivores, is introduced. Quite remarkably, high herbivore vitality destroys the stability of the entire biosphere in a way reminiscent of 'desertification'.

Further Exploration of Terrestrial Vegetation Response(s) to ENSO Variability Using a Mechanistic Vegetation Simulation Model	2005	The need for analysis of terrestrial vegetation interactions and interannual climate variability such as the ENSO is paramount as terrestrial vegetation is an important boundary condition for the climate system, and is the primary interactive surface for the atmosphere. Contemporary investigations have been focusing on non-synergistic investigations to approach this within the Earth System bar a few. A complete understanding of these interconnective processes within the Earth System is impossible without the synergistic approach involving the incorporation of remotely sensed data. This paper follows on the research of Manobavan et al. (2003), who using a synergistic approach showed/hypothesised that terrestrial South American vegetation may have become resilient to interannual climatic perturbations by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This paper further explores this possibility via simulations performed using the Hybrid Version 4.1, which was conditioned to incorporate ENSO related climatic variability. The results of this simulation modelling exercise support this hypothesis and show that the interannual perturbations such as the ENSO enhance the homeostatic property of the system rather than hinder it within its geophysiological limits. Moreover, this paper combines modelling and geophysiology thus attempting to provide a 'holistic' mechanistic explanation to the speculated behaviour of the terrestrial vegetation under perturbation by the ENSO.

System-dependent Selection, Ecological Feedback and the Emergence of Functional Structure in Ecosystems.	1998	Most models of natural selection assume either that the material environment remains constant or that it fluctuates in ways unrelated to changes in gene frequencies (and therefore changes in the distribution of phenotypes) of the organism undergoing selection. In this paper, we consider what happens when this assumption does not hold, that is, when ecological feedback between organism and environment is included in the evolutionary process. Specifically, we examine the unusual evolutionary dynamics that occur when changes in the distribution of phenotypes (resulting from selection) alter an environmental parameter in ways that, in turn, modify selection pressures. This process, which we term "system-dependent selection", can produce stable phenotypic diversity which functions to regulate the relevant environmental parameter within a much narrower range would occur in the absence of ecological feedback. This environmental regulation raises the mean fitness of the population and reduces variance in fitness among different phenotypes. Thus, system-dependent selection produces functional organization at the level of the system, as a whole, rather than at the level of the individual organism. We use James Lovelock's model of the imaginary planet Daisyworld to describe the unusual dynamics of this selective process and then use a similar model to examine the structure of an ancient system of wet-rice farming on the Indonesian island of Bali. This model accurately predicts the actual structure of functional organization along two Balinese rivers. We investigate the stability of such systems by exploring the conditions under which mutant phenotypes can invade Daisyworld. The results suggest that the phenotypic diversity and functional organization produced by system-dependent selection may be maintained when there exists variation, over evolutionary time, in the environmental parameters underlying system-dependent dynamics.Copyright 1998 Academic Press Limited	Journal of theoretical biology	{u'scopus': u'2-s2.0-0032493179', u'pmid': u'9735254', u'doi': u'10.1006/jtbi.1998.0664', u'isbn': u'0022-5193', u'issn': u'1095-8541'}	http://www.mendeley.com/research/systemdependent-selection-ecological-feedback-emergence-functional-structure-ecosystems
Environmental regulation can arise under minimal assumptions	2008	Models that demonstrate environmental regulation as a consequence of organism and environment coupling all require a number of core assumptions. Many previous models, such as Daisyworld, require that certain environment-altering traits have a selective advantage when those traits also contribute towards global regulation. We present a model that results in the regulation of a global environmental resource through niche construction without employing this and other common assumptions. There is no predetermined environmental optimum towards which regulation should proceed assumed or coded into the model. Nevertheless, polymorphic stable states that resist perturbation emerge from the simulated co-evolution of organisms and environment. In any single simulation a series of different stable states are realised, punctuated by rapid transitions. Regulation is achieved through two main subpopulations that are adapted to slightly different resource values, which force the environmental resource in opposing directions. This maintains the resource within a comparatively narrow band over a wide range of external perturbations. Population driven oscillations in the resource appear to be instrumental in protecting the regulation against mutations that would otherwise destroy it. Sensitivity analysis shows that the regulation is robust to mutation and to a wide range of parameter settings. Given the minimal assumptions employed, the results could reveal a mechanism capable of environmental regulation through the by-products of organisms. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Flask model: Emergence of nutrient-recycling microbial ecosystems and their disruption by environment-altering 'rebel' organisms	2007	Here we introduce a new model of life-environment interaction, which simulates an evolving microbial community in a 'Flask' of liquid with prescribed inputs of nutrients. The flask is seeded with a clonal population of 'microbes' that are subject to mutation on genetic loci that determine their nutrient uptake patterns, release patterns, and their effects on, and response to, other environmental variables. In contrast to existing models of life-environment interaction, notably Daisyworld, what benefits the individual organisms is decoupled from their 'global' (system-level) effects. A robust property of the model is the emergence of ecosystems that tend toward a state where nutrients are efficiently utilised and differentially recycled, with a correlated increase in total population. Organisms alter the environment as a free 'by-product' of their growth, and their growth is constrained by adverse environmental effects. This introduces environmental feedback, which can disrupt the model ecosystems, even though there are no constraints on the conditions to which the organisms can theoretically adapt. 'Rebel' organisms can appear that grow rapidly by exploiting an under-utilised resource, but in doing so shift the environment away from the state to which the majority of the community are adapted. The result can be a population crash with loss of recycling, followed by later recovery, or in extreme cases, a total extinction of the system. Numerous runs of these 'flask' ecosystems show that tighter environmental constraints on growth make the system more vulnerable to internally generated ecosystem extinction.
